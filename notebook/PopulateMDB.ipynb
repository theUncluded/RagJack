In a six deck game you will have the same running \\ncount but the advantage is not as great. \\nLooking at the actual number of cards we will see the differ\\x02ence. In our one deck example, there are 9 \"10s\" left and only 6 \\nof the others. If there are six decks in the shoe, and the same \\nnumber of cards have been dealt, you have 109 \"10s\" and 106', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/blackjack_rag/Ultimate BlackJack.txt'}), Document(page_content='of the others. If there are six decks in the shoe, and the same \\nnumber of cards have been dealt, you have 109 \"10s\" and 106 \\n\"other\" cards. It is clear that a 9:6 advantage is much differ\\x02ent than a 109:106 advantage. \\nThe easiest way to adjust for multiple decks is to divide your \\nrunning count by the number of decks. In our example, you would \\nhave an advantage of +3 if there were only one deck, but an ad\\x02vantage of +0.5 if there were six decks. ALL OF YOUR BET ADJUST- MENTS NEED TO BE BASED ON THE \"REAL\" COUNT. If you have a real \\ncount of +0.5, you have an advantage.

Let\\'s take a look at a simple bet adjustment \\nstrategy that can be mastered by anyone. Start with a base unit \\nfor your betting. Your bet on each hand should be calculated \\nbased on this base unit of betting as follows. Your \"default\" \\nbet is 2 times the base unit. When your \"real\" count drops below \\n0, drop your bet to the base unit. When your \"real\" count is \\ngreater than or equal to one, you should increase your \"default\" \\nbet by the amount equal to your base unit times the count. \\nLet\\'s look at an example.

When the count is +1, you will bet \\n$15 ( $10 + $5 times count). If the count is +3, you will bet \\n$25, etc. \\nIs Counting Cards Illegal? \\nIn a word, no! Many people think that casinos implement rules to \\ntry and deter card counters, but the truth is that the rules are \\nusually implemented to deter cheating and many times these rules \\ndo put counters at a disadvantage.

Unfortunately, most casinos will resort \\nto all sort of tactics to keep you from standing around a table \\nand studying play at the table.

After all cards are dealt, your\\ncount should be zero. If you get good at this at increasing \\nspeeds, you should move to dealing off the cards in pairs and \\nlearn to count two at a time.

L. Kelly, is much \\nmore complex than the system we learned earlier but it is much \\nmore efficient. This system dictates that the player should bet \\nthe percent of his bankroll that corresponds to the probabilis-\\ntic advantage you have on that hand. If your bankroll is $1,000 \\nand you have a 1% edge, you will bet $10. If you have a 2.5% \\nedge, you will bet $25.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/blackjack_rag/Ultimate BlackJack.txt'}), Document(page_content=\"and you have a 1% edge, you will bet $10.
