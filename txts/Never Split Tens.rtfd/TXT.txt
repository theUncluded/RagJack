\fs32 \cf3 Of the fifty or so patrons standing by the craps table, the only men who stared at tthe $10,000 in $500 and $1000 gambling chips that the enticing Rosette had laid down were the eunuchs. A sign noting \'93Reserved for Private Party\'94 sat on the table. Rosette wore an alluringly clinging orange chiffon dress, which coordinated nicely with her orange-colored $1000 \'93pumpkin\'94 chips. Maybe those were real pink pearls that dangled from her necklace. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The ca-chinking of slot machines competed with live music, multiple conversations, and the nearby roulette croupier call of \'93Rien ne va plus.\'94 With their senses of sight and hearing overloaded with these multiple inputs, the sensory-inebriated crowd at the craps table laughed and yelled encouragement as Rosette rolled the dice and implored the gods of the craps table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bring it home to your sweet peach pie momma. Momma needs a few new pairs of shoes!\'94 Rosette apparently liked posh footwear. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 My dad was seated about thirty yards away, the only player at a blackjack table. Large stacks of $25 chips lay on the table in front of him. He was play- ing three hands at the same time, and next to each were $100 in $25 chips. A King of Spades and ten of Hearts, a Queen of Clubs and a Queen of Diamonds, and a Jack of Clubs and a ten of Clubs, each hand with a value of 20, good blackjack hands, stared upward at the ceiling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The dealer seemed mildly interested. She had seen it all, no doubt, but maybe not quite this. Her frilly white blouse obscured some wrinkled neck

\fs32 \cf3 skin, the indication of either too much weight or too much sun. \'93Betty Lou\'94 read her I.D. name tag. Her up-card, a four of Clubs, must have felt out of place in the presence of all that royalty. Her down card. .. Well, they\'92d soon all find out. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 My dad, Edward Oakley Thorp, sat in the chair by the stacks of chips. The twenty or so people watching were hushed. The noise was as loud as a Tibetan monk\'92s breathing while in the lotus position at sunrise. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Betty Lou held the deck of cards in her left hand. Oakley \'96 my sisters and I usually called him by his middle name, his father\'92s first name \'96 stared at the Jack of Clubs and ten of Clubs. He deliberately slid the ten of Clubs to the right of the Jack of Clubs and took four $25 chips from one of the stacks of chips and placed them next to the ten of Clubs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 he announced to Betty Lou. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The crowd gasped. Dad now had four hands on the table. Was this the stupidest man they had ever seen or the cleverest? Betty Lou dealt a ten of Diamonds on top of the Jack of Clubs and a nine of Hearts on top of the ten of Clubs. He now had four pat hands. Maybe he was the cleverest man. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Betty Lou stared at Oakley. Maybe she was daring him to split again. Maybe she didn\'92t care. I\'92d bet on the latter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley waved his hand over the cards, indicating he was standing pat with each of his four hands. No more splitting. Betty Lou flipped over her down card or, as gamblers refer to it, the \'93hole card,\'94 to reveal a nine of Hearts, for a total of 13 if you\'92re counting along. She dealt herself a Jack of Spades. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dealer busts,\'94 she announced, although the applause of the crowd extolling the David-like victory of their hero signaled the redundancy of such words. She took sixteen $25 chips from her faux-gilded tray of chips and placed four next to each of Oakley\'92s winning bets. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s customary to tip the dealer for continued good luck from the blackjack gods,\'94 she advised. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, that\'92s the problem. I\'92m an atheist,\'94 Oakley countered. It was clear already that he and Rosette, assuming they would somehow meet, would never attain a satisfying spiritual connection. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 My dad was never really a nerdy math type of guy. He looked like a nerdy math type of guy, but surviving as a young boy in a blue-collar neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago meant you had to be, if not tough, at least a smart-aleck. Oakley was definitely a smart-aleck. At this time he was in his late 20s. He was tall and thin, not athletic or muscled. If he\'92d been an athlete they would have called him \'93lanky.\'94 That appearance and the ever-present black-rimmed glasses fought a continual battle with his personality, the smart- aleck personality. If he had been born in, say, New York, Brooklyn, the Bronx, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 any of those areas, no doubt he would have become one of the world\'92s biggest nerds, just like my college roommate. But he wasn\'92t, and I was proud of him. All of us were, me, my sisters, and my mom. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Raking in his winnings, Oakley barely noticed a casino manager sitting down next to him. His red tie hung loosely at the neck, lying over a white-on- white embroidered shirt, the logo \'93Harrahs\'94 embroidered onto it. He didn\'92t wear a name tag. The buxom woman accompanying him could have been Rosette\'92s sister. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s a nice stack of chips,\'94 the manager observed. Oakley stared at the woman.\uc0\u8232 \'93You should know,\'94 he said, being, yes, the smart-aleck. \'93Splitting tens. Beginner\'92s luck, I guess, huh?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Tsk, tsk. Don\'92t you know you don\'92t never split tens?\'94\u8232 \'93Oh, you know, I forgot.\'94\u8232 Sticking his face into Oakley\'92s, the manager tilted his head. \'93I seem to 
\fs24 \

\fs32 reco\'92nize your face. You were on t.v. for somethin\'92 or somethin\'92, right?\'94 \'93Splitting tens.\'94\uc0\u8232 I think Oakley should have quit while he was ahead. The manager without 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a name went to scratch his nose and knocked the pile of chips in front of Oakley to the floor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, I\'92m so sorry. Please do allow me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley bent over to pick up the chips, and the manager dove beneath the chairs with him. He elbowed Oakley in the kidney. You could still hear the clamor of excitement coming from Rosette\'92s craps table over Oakley\'92s restrained groans. As in the wild, never let your predator know your level of distress. It\'92s what Oakley learned in the neighborhood. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Pulling himself up, Oakley found two muscular security guards standing by the table. These were the kind of miscreants who really, really, wanted to be cops, only their cognitive skills didn\'92t allow them to pass the exam. No prob- lem existed with their psychological makeup. Not especially needing the rein- forcements, the manager advised, \'93We don\'92t want your action here, pal.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, and I thought you were just trying to pick my pocket.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The security guards didn\'92t respond particularly affectionately to this wise crack. They grabbed Oakley by either arm and dragged him away from the table. Oakley struggled to keep his balance. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Your chips\'92ll be counted and the cash it\'92ll be waiting for you at the cage.\'94 \'93How thoughtful.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93We don\'92t want you here. You got. .. body odor, right Jimmy?\'94\u8232 \'93Right,\'94 said one of the guards. \'93You offend my smelling bad.\'94

\f2\i\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf3 Three Months Earlier CBS Television Studios New York City 
\f1\i0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 On the right side of the stage of the television show \'93To Tell The Truth,\'94 as seen from the live studio audience, three, well, nerdy-looking men sat. They all wore black-rimmed glasses. They all had greenish, brownish tweed jackets over a white shirt and a black tie. They all looked like college pro- fessors. Maybe they all were college professors, but at the beginning of the show I could only be sure that Oakley was one. He was at MIT at the time. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The genial host, beloved by all Americans for his quiet, respectful wit, was Bud Collyer. He always seemed to have a chuckle in his voice, a result no doubt of truly enjoying his job. His desk sat to the left of the professor- contestants and faced that of the four celebrity panelists. I always loved that term, \'93celebrity panelists.\'94 Why not just \'93celebrities\'94 or \'93panelists\'94 or, for that matter, \'93guest stars\'94? \'93Celebrity panelists\'94 seemed to be a term embraced by all Americans. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Tom Poston, the comic actor, was one, sitting on the far left end of the panel as viewed by the contestants. Then there were Peggy Cass, the comic actress, Orson Bean, another comic actor, and, at the far right end, the glamorous Kitty Carlisle. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Kitty wore a dress that had a rigid vertical bodice, cantilevered out about six inches from her body. I\'92m sure her dress designer was also the costume designer for Ming the Merciless, as played by Charles Middleton in the clas- sic Flash Gordon series of Oakley\'92s boyhood. After the question and answer portion of the program was concluded and the panel voted, Oakley would shake hands with Ms. Carlisle first. Vivian, who was to become my mom, was there as well, mingling with the celebrities and Edward Thorp imper- sonators, her genuineness and always well-coiffured moderate-length blonde hair guaranteeing that she would be noticed among the celebrities. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Bud spoke to the camera. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s our distinguished celebrity panel, and now let\'92s meet our special guests.\'94 The nerdy men spoke in turn. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93My name is Edward Thorp.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93My name is Edward Thorp.\'94\u8232 \'93My name is Edward Thorp.\'94\u8232 It was now time for Bud to provide the background information. Then the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 celebrity panelists would interrogate the three, trying to determine who was \'93the real Edward Thorp.\'94 At the end of the show, after the panelists voted, Bud would say, \'93Will the real Edward Thorp please stand up.\'94 Often, the guy who two or most of the panelists thought was the real special guest would start to rise from his seat, then sit own, and then the real surprise guest would stand up to audience applause. Sometimes they had two fake risings. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Sometimes, if I remember, the real guest would rise, then sit down, then rise again. It\'92s amazing how you can create so many combinations of risings and sittings among three people. A celebrity of sorts in his own right, the real surprise guest would answer a few questions from the celebrity panel. On this show, Oakley would rise and stay risen. Two of the four panelists would correctly guess he was the real Edward Thorp. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 First, Bud had to provide that aforementioned background. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward Thorp is a professor of mathematics. At the age of seven, he was calculating in his head the number of seconds in a year. While at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he developed a technique called \'91card counting\'92 that has enabled him to win tens of thousands of dollars playing the game of blackjack in casinos from Las Vegas to Puerto Rico. His book on the subject, 
\f2\i Beat the Dealer
\f1\i0 , made 
\f2\i The New York Times 
\f1\i0 best-seller list. It is currently the most frequently requested volume in the Las Vegas Public Library.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After this public library note, Oakley broke into a wide, obviously genuine grin, a beaming smile he possessed that could illuminate an entire room. It\'92s surprising that not all the panelists would guess, on that evidence alone, that he was the real Edward Thorp. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Peggy Cass, let\'92s start the questioning with you.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Collegiate Jazz Festival, the PCCJF, at Berkeley. Zellerbach Auditorium stands on the west side of Lower Sproul Plaza. You walk down the stairs to the plaza, and it looms in front of you. Mr. Zellerbach must have been a heavy alumni donor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 All the student demonstrations, okay, riots, during the Free Speech Movement of a later decade, would be held up the stairs, to the east, toward the Berkeley hills, on Upper Sproul Plaza, or simply, as it was usually called, Sproul Plaza. Because it faced the administration building, Sproul Plaza, with the leg- endary Ludwig\'92s Fountain, named after a famous frolicking dog, allowed fren- zied students to walk straight to the stairs of the administration building for their sit-ins or love-ins or whatever \'93in\'94 was on the activist menu that day. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Lower Sproul Plaza, on the other hand, was a football-field-sized area for throwing Frisbees and listening to the loosely structured bongo band on a Sunday afternoon. Oakley told me the interplay of rhythms was both mesmer- izing and relaxing. Completely unstructured, without a solo, there were up to a dozen men, each playing a given rhythm over and over. They played, literally, and I don\'92t mean figuratively, I mean literally, for hours. Once, a white guy with no idea of the protocol started playing a solo. Oakley told me the guy got corrected quickly. Nothing is quite like a bunch of guys with foot-high Afros skewering you visually \'96 figuratively, not literally. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At intermissions of concerts, the audience would stream out onto the plaza. No problems with traffic or bus noise would greet them. They\'92d just look up at the sky and enjoy the stars and the Moon until the house lights would flash, announcing the end of intermission and the beginning of the second part of the concert. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was about 10:30 p.m. this Saturday night, and the winners of the com- petitions had been announced. The host band, from UC Berkeley, had invited the UCLA band to perform with them for the final concert. They both sat on the stage. The guest soloist, drummer Ed Shaughnessy from L.A., was playing with the host band from Berkeley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The music stands in front of the saxophone players from UCLA had \'93Bruin Big Band\'94 written on them in a fancy script. Maybe it was Peinaud. The music stands in front of the saxophone players from the Berkeley band simply had \'93UC Jazz\'94 written on them, in block letters. Maybe Helvetica. If you were a high school band member attending the concert you got the unsubtle mes- sage that UCLA values football over academics while Berkeley values academ- ics over football. I guess Zellerbach appreciated that. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The auditorium was jammed. Dave LeFebvre was directing the Bruin big band, and Dr. David W. Tucker was directing the UC jazz band. An audience of not only the college musicians performing at the festival but also Berkeley students and Bay Area jazz fans filled the auditorium. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, at the time 22 years old, stood in front of the bands. He played sensuous trumpet riffs accompanying a woman vocalist. That was Vivian, who as I said was to become my mom. Oakley played a top-of-the-line trumpet, the Vincent Bach Stradivarius. Along with the Benge, it was the finest trum- pet of the era. If you, of course, had a lot of money, and were a symphony trumpet player or big-time jazz player, you could get Roland Schilke in Chicago to make one of his hand-made silver Schilke trumpets for you. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The Bach served Oakley well enough. It had a nice dark sound. I remember he complained that the E at the top of the staff was a little flat, so he had to use the alternative first and second valve fingering to stay in tune. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian, in her early 20s, about five feet three inches tall, was slim, and wore an alluring but sophisticated cocktail dress. Vivian possessed the aura of a society gal, one of the 500, invited to the Cotillions, the coming-out parties. She always carried herself with respect. I still don\'92t know exactly why she went for a nerdy mathematician. I guess, no, I\'92m fairly sure, she loved his intellect. He kept her off-balance with his smart-aleck personality. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 I learned in my dating years that after a while a lot of women get tired of being wined and dined by the shallow types. One of my girlfriends, after we moved back to southern California for Oakley\'92s position at UC Irvine, told me why she was attracted to me. Deborah Elwood said to me, \'93Because you\'92re a good man.\'94 Mom, Vivian, must have felt the same way about Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She sang the tune \'93I\'92ve Never Been in Love Before,\'94 accompanied by Oakley playing licks and the joint bands: 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f2\i\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf3 I\'92ve never been in love before,\uc0\u8232 Now all at once it\'92s you,\u8232 It\'92s you forever more.\u8232 I\'92ve never been in love before,\u8232 I thought my heart was safe,\u8232 I thought I knew the score.\u8232 But this is wine that\'92s all too strange and strong.

\f2\i\fs29\fsmilli14667 And out my song must pour.\uc0\u8232 So please forgive this helpless haze I\'92m in, I\'92ve never really been in love before.\'94 
\f1\i0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 She stared at Oakley as she sang. Everyone in the hall must have gotten the feeling the look had more content than to ensure they were on the same musi- cal page. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now it was Oakley\'92s turn. He played eighteen bars, the first two stanzas, and then Vivian came back with the chorus.

\fs32 \cf3 When the tune was over, the audience applauded, as much for the music as for the admittedly syrupy sensuality, I\'92m sure. There were whistles and cheers, too. Oakley and Vivian continued staring at each other. I\'92d bet more than one person in the audience was thinking, \'93Get a room!\'94 respectable society girl or not. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Les, the emcee, walked onto the stage, applauding. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Let\'92s hear it for the Bruin Big Band from UCLA, under the direction of David LeFebvre, and trumpeter Ed Thorp.\'94 He pointed to them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah! And our own Wednesday Night Band from the University of California, Berkeley, under the direction of Dr. David W. Tucker. Yeah! Featuring Vivian, Vivian Artisen on vocals.\'94 Again, he pointed to them. \'93Let\'92s hear it! Come on!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley and Vivian held hands, stared at each other, and smiled.

\fs24 \

\fs32 If you drive east on Ashby Avenue southeast of the UC Berkeley campus, past the Claremont Hotel, you\'92d enter the tunnel that would take you under the Berkeley hills to the communities of Concord and Walnut Creek. There, sum- mer days often have temperatures in the 90s. Similarly, south of the Burlingame hills you\'92ll find the temperatures in the south Bay, Santa Clara, San Jose, and Palo Alto, to be considerably warmer than in San Francisco. The weather in San Francisco, Oakland, El Cerrito, Richmond, Hayward, Berkeley, and other towns within those hills is dominated by the cool temperatures of the bay. In the morning and evenings you frequently have to wear a light jacket. It was typically chilly this Sunday morning at 8:00 a.m. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The guitar player with the UCLA band sat on somebody\'92s trumpet case next to the bus waiting on Bancroft Avenue behind Eshleman Hall and alter- nately played riffs from \'93Joy Spring\'94 and blew on his fingers for warmth. A couple of band members helped the drummer carry his set from Zellerbach to the bus. They loaded it into the belly of the bus and then stood around listening to the guitar player before climbing into the bus for the ride back to a warm Los Angeles. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley walked to the bus carrying his trumpet case. Vivian held his free hand with one hand and carried a bottle with the other. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here\'92s some orange juice for the ride. To replenish your energy.\'94 \'93Excellent! Something to remember you by. Well, it was nice.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Is that it, then? Just a one-night stand between starving student musicians?\'94 \'93I\'92m not starving.\'94 He sipped from the bottle. \'93Not now, anyway.\'94\u8232 \'93A one-night stand then it is.\'94\u8232 \'93Correct me if I\'92m wrong,\'94 said Oakley, \'93but Friday night and Saturday 
\fs24 \

\fs32 night. That makes it a two-night stand.\'94\uc0\u8232 Vivian unclasped her hand from Oakley\'92s and gestured as she sang a line 
\fs24 \

\fs32 from \'93These Foolish Things.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley took another sip. \'93Yes, a libation worthy of Edward the Conqueror. Except, I think you said I\'92m the greatest trumpet player ever. You conquered me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So this is it,\'94 said Vivian beginning to be resigned.\uc0\u8232 \'93Depends. What do you mean by \'91it\'92?\'94\u8232 \'93Just like a law student! If you weren\'92t such a good kisser.\'94\u8232 The other musicians had long ago climbed into the bus. The driver beeped

Well, g\'92bye.\'94\u8232 \'93Edward?!\'94\u8232 \'93I gotta go home now and train my embouchure.\'94\u8232 \'93But!\'94\u8232 \'93Is seven o\'92clock okay with you?\'94\u8232 \'93What?\'94\u8232 \'93Seven o\'92clock.

\fs32 the turn of the twentieth century lived in small apartments in the Maxwell Street area. After earning a little money they moved west to the Lawndale district, centered on Douglas Boulevard and its wide boulevard park. The elementary school was named Theodore Herzl, after the pioneering Zionist. Immigrants from each little town, or 
\f2\i shtetl
\f1\i0 , in Eastern Europe had formed their own orthodox synagogue along Douglas Boulevard. To this day, those synagogues remain, now converted to churches or community centers as the Jewish families have long sincenmoved. Jews with some wealth opted instead for the Hyde Park neighborhood, its focus being the University of Chicago. They would always consider themselves superior to the west side Jews. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As the Lawndale district changed, the Jewish families there moved further west to the Austin neighborhood. By the 1960s and 1970s those neighbor- hoods also changed, and the Jews as well as other Europeans moved further west or to the northern Chicago suburbs. The Braun family settled in a mod- est home on Long Avenue, one block north of Madison Street with its kosher bakeries, grocery stores, and butchers. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Austin at that time was home to a mixture of European descendants. The Jews lived north of Washington Boulevard. The Italians lived south of Washington Boulevard. They would each keep their property immaculate so

\fs24 \

\fs32 Inevitably, fights between the two groups occurred. Although the Jewish kids idolized their professional wrestler, Ruffy Silverstein, if some 
\f2\i telener 
\f1\i0 did them wrong, they would go to the Jewish enforcer, Larry Rosenberg, a tough kid who was with them at Austin High. Julian Braun had never mixed with the tough kids. He had been and remained a young man of the books. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The living room of the Braun family home was modestly decorated with a sofa, love seat, lamp tables, and shelves of books. Jewish homes are deposi- tories of books. The complete 
\f2\i Encyclopedia Judaica 
\f1\i0 sat on the top shelf. The small dining room connected to the living room. It had a breakfront and a solid oak dining room table surrounded with chairs upholstered in red cloth. Unless company was invited, the dining room table would always be covered with 1/4
\f3 \uc0\u8242 \u8242 
\f1  leather-covered cardboard padding, to protect the wood. Tonight the padding had been removed and the 
\f2\i Shabbos 
\f1\i0 table cloth, of white vinyl with drawings in gold of fruit and flowers, was placed on the table. For Sabbath dinner that night, the table was set with silverware and dishes, a vase of flowers, Sabbath candles, and a loaf of challah bread on a silver tray par- tially covered with a white cloth. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian Braun wore glasses. He sat on the living room sofa being lectured by his parents.

\fs32 \'93And we both want you to find a place of your own.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Two others, the Redman parents, slept in the living room, slumped on the living room sofa. It was nearly 1:00 a.m. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The decorations of Julian\'92s bedroom were nouveau American Intellectual. His stamp collection, framed, hung on the wall. A card table stood in the very center of the room, the only significant furniture outside of a bed and a chest of drawers. A chess board with chess pieces sat on the card table. Many of the chess pieces lay on the table off to the side of the board. Julian and Nancy sat at the card table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nancy Redman, also in her mid-20s, had short-cut black hair. She was thin, not strikingly attractive, not voluptuously attractive, but attractive. She had no outstandingly bad physical attributes. She had those blue eyes that have passed through to modern Jews resulting from the adoption of Judaism in the Middle Ages by a western Europe-bound tribe of fair-skinned Mongolians. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Trivial,\'94 judged Julian. \'93Just assign a probability to each of your oppo- nent\'92s possible moves and then a random number generator selects the move based on the pre-assigned skill level and the various probabilities.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Random number generator. Based on a digit of pi?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Any irrational number would work, but it\'92s hard to avoid repetition of the sequence. Linear generators are better. The next in the sequence is a linear combination of the previous in the sequence modulo an integer.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But then the sequence would be limited in length to the value of the modulus, right?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Clearly. So I\'92m using several in parallel with different values for the coef- ficients and then I use a master to select among the parallel generators.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s great. Even the error that a player might make could be assigned a probability. All the moves don\'92t have to be rationally based.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s an interesting point,\'94 Julian approved. Then he laughed. \'93Throw in the possibility of stupid moves.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They both laughed at the concept. Nancy moved a knight. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, now you\'92ve moved your knight, and we reinitialize all the variables and begin a new decision tree.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Unless you have enough memory to have set up decision trees on all the possible moves from the beginning of the match.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s the beauty of the 704/709 computing machine I have at work. We finally have enough memory and speed.\'94 Julian wasn\'92t prone to bragging. He was simply being factual. He continued in a Yiddish accent, lifting his finger to the sky as a learned sage might have done in ages past. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dere vill come ah time. ..\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nancy laughed, and Julian, relishing the response, joined her in laughter. This high-brow frivolity was interrupted by a jiggling of the bedroom door knob and then a knock on the bedroom door. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s one o\'92clock,\'94 exclaimed Anne, now in the role of Mrs. Braun, from beyond the locked door. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why is the door locked? The Redmans want to go home.

\fs32 \cf3 If you want a gambling vacation and live in northern California, you go to Reno. If you want a romantic vacation, and like skiing as well as a little gam- bling, you go to South Lake Tahoe. Stateline, Nevada, is the town. Like Reno and Las Vegas, it has numerous marriage chapels and convenience stores. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had kept his promise and had taken Vivian to South Lake Tahoe. They stood in line at the cash register in the convenience store. I doubt they\'92d remember the name. As all convenience stores, a rack of cigarette boxes hung on the wall. The clerk\'92s name tag read \'93C. Patel\'94 The most common surname of sub-continent India, Mr. Patel must have, judging from the latest interna- tional population figures, 10 million or so namesakes. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley held a half gallon of ice cream and a jar of peanut butter. A cus- tomer dressed in a red plaid flannel shirt, jeans, and cap, standard trucker uniform, stood in front of them. He was filling out a Nevada lottery ticket. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Excuse, me. My wife is due in five months, and we don\'92t want to have the baby delivered here,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You will have to wait your turn,\'94 responded Patel. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley went into professor mode. \'93You might as give me your dollar,\'94 he said to the trucker-type. \'93You\'92re not going to win.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley had to take on the challenge. He was, of course, perfectly able to do so. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay. Okay. You\'92ve got fifty-two numbers to choose from, right? How many ways can you pick five numbers from those fifty-two? It\'92s fifty-two times fifty-one times fifty times forty-nine times forty-eight ways of doing that. Since the order doesn\'92t matter, you have five factorial ways of choosing the winning numbers. So fifty-two times fifty-one times fifty times forty-nine times forty- eight divided by five factorial, which is one hundred and twenty, is about,\'94 he paused. \'93Two and a half million. Your chances of winning are about one in two and a half million. And my wife craves some ice cream and peanut butter.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Somebody\'92s gotta win.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Actually, closer to one in two point six million.\'94 Oakley had had another second to think. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ll make you a deal. See the cigarette boxes? There are what, five rows, about twenty boxes in each row? I\'92ll write down the location of one of the boxes and I\'92ll bet you five dollars you can\'92t pick the box I wrote down. I\'92ll pay you one hundred dollars if you get it right.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Mr. Trucker laughed mockingly, like a guy who\'92s too smart to be taken in by a shyster. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s got to be a couple hundred boxes. No way, pal!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was not lost on Oakley that five times twenty is one hundred. He began to wonder if all the members of this fellow\'92s family had vestigial brains, but then stopped himself mid-thought as being unattractively judgmental. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The chances are one in a hundred but the chances in the lottery are one in two and a half million. Two point six,\'94 he said instead. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Somebody\'92s gotta win.\'94\uc0\u8232 Mr. C. Patel had had enough and wanted to avoid violence, I\'92m sure. \'93Okay. Okay. What do you have there?\'94\u8232 \'93Ice cream. Butter pecan. She craves it.\'94\u8232 \'93I thought you also wanted peanut butter.\'94\u8232 \'93She changed her mind. You changed your mind, right, honey bun?\'94 \'93Uh, yeah,\'94 Vivian, her mind still digesting the numbers, agreed. \'93Women!\'94\u8232 Their purchase made, Oakley and Vivian walked to his car in the parking 
\fs24 \

\fs32 lot. It was, as noted, a bright red Ford Thunderbird. She carried a bag with the ice cream. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What was that about?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s outburst had put him in a precarious situation. He had to think quickly to get out of this one. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Just playing games. Besides, you don\'92t look pregnant.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian didn\'92t buy it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, no, no. I\'92m not talking about the silly pregnant wife thing. The numbers.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It\'92s hard for a math genius to play dumb, but Oakley tried. \'93Yeah?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93How\'92d you do the numbers?\'94\u8232 \'93Just made \'91em up.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian still didn\'92t buy it. Oakley was a lousy liar, anyway. Two of the celeb- rity panelists, after all, had guessed he was \'93the real Edward Thorp.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, you didn\'92t. I saw your mind working. I could see the smoke com- ing out of your ears.\'94 My dad didn\'92t realize that my mom had transcendent powers and particularly acute ocular ability. She may even have possessed tetrachromacy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward, how\'92d you do the numbers? Are you some kind of math genius or something?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley looked at the fender of the T-Bird, wet his finger, and rubbed a spot. That one particular tiny dent bothered him every time he approached the car. Now perhaps Vivian would change the subject. He opened the car door for her and nibbled on her ear. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, so it\'92s ear envy, huh?\'94 He handed her the car keys with a modest request, \'93Can you put on the jazz station?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley walked around the car. Vivian stuck the key into the ignition and turned on the radio. He hoped the interrogation was over as he slid into the driver\'92s seat of: the T-Bird. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A miniature dart board hung from the rear view mirror. Unfortunately, the radio was not playing jazz, but, instead, his anathema, country music. Patsy Cline singing \'93Walkin\'92 After Midnight\'94 was playing loudly, too loudly, on the car radio. Oakley knew the probing wasn\'92t over.

Oakley might have been in a bare warehouse, strapped to a wooden chair with 200-watt light bulbs shining in his face so that he couldn\'92t see the faces of those grilling him about his seditious activities.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley had been advised by one or more professors as an undergraduate at Cornell that cramming for exams was deleterious to your performance. You\'92d do better if you just cleared your brain for an hour or even a half an hour before the exam, particularly the two- or three-hour-long final exams, if you just took a walk. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley wasn\'92t aware at that time of the two modes of processing of the brain. Working on an exam utilizes the left mode of processing, the sequential, analytical mode. This was true even if you\'92re writing an essay for an English exam. You still put the words on the paper one by one, in sequence. The right mode of brain processing, in contrast, is global, synthetic. I hate to use the word \'93creative,\'94 but creativity seems to flow from right-brain processing. If Oakley, while he was an undergraduate at Cornell University, had been aware of the split-brain research being done by Roger Sperry now thirty miles away from him at Cal Tech he would certainly have embraced regularly taking a stroll before exams. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 His senior year at Cornell, he gave it a shot on a professor\'92s recommenda- tion. He performed brilliantly on the exam and from then on he followed the same routine. His chosen route was from College Town, past the Law School and Engineering Quad, past Willard Straight Hall, and onto the Arts Quad. He told me that he did deviate it from it once, before a cultural anthropology class he took as an elective. He noted that so many facts had to be retained for each tribe, their tools, institutions, and religion, for a few, that cramming until the last minute seemed the only way to get an \'93A\'94 in the class. He slept for only one hour the night before the final exam, and aced it, to use the phrase in vogue at that time at Cornell.

\fs32 \cf3 At UCLA he found a route that also worked. His path of choice was north on the southeast part of campus, parallel to Hilgard Avenue. Plenty of palm trees graced the campus, but this route passed by a pine grove and its curious squirrels. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was walking with Professor Angus Taylor, age 43, and Allan Wilson, age 31, a mathematics post-doctoral student and Oakley\'92s best friend. Professor Taylor was to author a book in 1959 on calculus, 
\f2\i Calculus with Analytical Geometry
\f1\i0 , that was to become a standard in colleges for decades. He was Oakley\'92s Ph.D. advisor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan shuffled a deck of cards with one hand. He often brought it with him to class if the class became boring. Allan himself was a bright fellow. All three carried notebooks as they strolled through campus from the Mathematical Sciences building to get an ice cream cone at the Terrace Food Court. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was bothered by the lack of an attractive name for the building where he spent most of his time. Whereas many buildings on campus were named after donors, the buildings housing engineering, math, and the sci- ences had generic names. \'93Geology,\'94 \'93Physics and Astronomy Building,\'94 and \'93Mathematics Sciences Building\'94 were institutionally bland enough. You had to wonder, though, about the effect on the psychologies of engi- neering students whose studies were housed in, and I\'92m not making this up, \'93Engineering I,\'94 \'93Engineering IV,\'94 and \'93Engineering V.\'94 I don\'92t know what happened to II and III. Oakley would reminisce about the Ivy-covered names at his alma mater, Goldwin Smith Hall, Morrill Hall, and Lincoln Hall. Even the buildings on the Engineering Quad had names: Phillips Hall, Carpenter Hall, where the 
\f2\i Cornell Engineer 
\f1\i0 student-run magazine had its offices, Kimball Hall, and so on. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was a typical end of class tumult, with students and faculty everyone going from one class to another or to a library. The over-abundance of pul- chritude would distract a blind monk. You know, the altruistic type, those who would volunteer to lead seeing people across the street. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan stopped shuffling the deck to offer a suggestion to Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93You gotta tell her sooner or later, Ed.\'94\u8232 \'93What do the cards say?\'94 asked Oakley.\u8232 Allan knew that a standard deck of 52 cards couldn\'92t provide the answer. \'93Dr. Taylor, do you happen to have a deck of tarot cards? I left mine at 
\fs24 \

\fs32 home,\'94 asked Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Ed, you should be proud of being a mathematician. It\'92s the language of 
\fs24 \

\fs32 science. Maybe she\'92ll get excited by it,\'94 said Professor Taylor. Oakley didn\'92t think it was the best advice. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. Honey, wanna get a look at my hypotenuse? Can I bisect your acute angle with my linear operator?\'94 Professor Taylor, as all brilliant men, had an excellent sense of humor. You could joke with him and not feel awkward. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s funny. Why do mathematicians always have to prove themselves?\'94 Oakley wondered out loud. Professor Taylor loved it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Now, that\'92s an interesting existential concept.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all laughed at the implications. Professor Taylor greatly enjoyed ban- tering with his students. They would soon become his colleagues, and very little compares with the camaraderie of bright academics gathered at holiday parties or in the evenings at their annual academic meetings. Truly bright people have a shine in their physiognomies, generated I think by their ultra- sensitivity to stimuli. It\'92s like a San Andreas fault earthquake. The first time you experience it, you don\'92t know what it is, but after being told, \'93Oh, did you feel the earthquake?\'94 you\'92ll be aware of it forever and can become the instructor for the newcomers who hadn\'92t yet experienced it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 So it is with the faces of the intellectually gifted. You can recognize the shine in their faces, but until you\'92re told that the person is a brilliant astrono- mer or mathematician or book editor, you don\'92t know its origin, just what it is. Henceforth, you\'92re sensitized to, and aware of, the glow. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93He\'92s right,\'94 agreed Allan. \'93Use math humor on her.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Come on. She finds out I\'92m lying about being a law student and it\'92s all over.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Professor Taylor felt a need to defend his profession.\uc0\u8232 \'93You know, you can get rich doing mathematics.\'94\u8232 \'93No,\'94 countered Allan, \'93I proved the contrary for my master\'92s thesis.\'94 \'93Ah, that\'92s right. Brilliant piece of work.\'94 They all laughed at Professor 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Taylor\'92s affability. The laughing ceased for a moment as a particularly pulchri- tudinous student sauntered past. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Excuse me, does math humor turn you on? Can I show you my linear operator?\'94 asked Oakley. She glared at the three of them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nerd.\'94\uc0\u8232 This irritated my dad. He lost his sense of humor.\u8232 \'93I am not a nerd,\'94 cried out Oakley. Professor Taylor was mildly shocked 
\fs24 \

\fs32 at the change in Oakley. \'93Hey!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan had to explain. He\'92d seen this manifestation before. It was like a cloud prowling in the back of Oakley\'92s mind. With the proper provocation, it would emerge and blot out the rational, brilliant mind of my father. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s a sore point. Some of his schoolmates used to call him a nerd.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 At Oakley\'92s manual urging, they sat down on a bench to observe the view. He had to broach the obvious subject. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s coming to a head. I\'92m going up to Berkeley again this weekend, and she\'92s asking the wrong questions.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Time for us, then, to go to Plan B,\'94 suggested Professor Taylor.\uc0\u8232 \'93What was Plan A?\'94\u8232 \'93The linear operator joke,\'94 Allan said in mock support.\u8232 \'93I think you and Allan should take your girlfriends to Lake Tahoe. Try out 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the blackjack system Baldwin and his group just published in the 
\f2\i Journal of the American Statistical Association
\f1\i0 .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hey, want to go to Tahoe with me and some math friends this weekend?\'94 Allan yelled after the woman student who had spurned Oakley. \'93We can talk about Baldwin\'92s paper.\'94 He turned to Professor Taylor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Interesting stuff.\'94 Professor Sorgenfrey, their colleague, had in fact already had shown the paper to Oakley, who had shared it with Allan. Now back to academic mode, Oakley agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Very interesting stuff.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93She obviously likes your mind. Show her a good time. Then, after a nice dinner, tell her the facts of life,\'94 Professor Taylor continued. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, Dr. Taylor, I think she knows the facts of life,\'94 Oakley noted, divulg- ing what no one would consider a state secret. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No sex talk on campus!\'94 Allan reminded them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Facts of life. You mean, that you can\'92t get rich doing mathematics?\'94 bemoaned Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all paused in resignation. \'93Well, maybe you can,\'94 Oakley continued with some hope. Remember what Shakespeare\'92s Julius Caesar said.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 I join all the others who think that \'93Barney\'92s\'94 is a stupid name for a casino. I mean, who is Barney? Sounds like a farmer to me. Maybe he was a farmer and then got tired of it and so he built a casino in some soybean field. No one names a casino after their first name. You have Harrah\'92s and the Riverside Hotel. Name it Cal Neva, to attract residents of both California and Nevada. Calling it Neva Cal would have sounded too much like a food supplement, so they chose Cal Neva. Casino restaurant food has a bad enough reputation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then you have all the gambling-sounding names and desert-sounding names. The Four Queens. The Golden Nugget. The Mint. The Horseshoe. The Sands. The Dunes. The Stardust. The Wagon Wheel. The Westward Ho is a motel, but it\'92s still a western sounding name. Yes, I know about Harold\'92s casino in Reno, but that is Reno. I just can\'92t understand naming a casino after Barney. I expect to find one named Billy Bob\'92s or Bubba\'92s. Maybe it\'92s the letter \'93B\'94 at fault. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In any case, although they took rooms at the more luxurious Harrah\'92s, Barney\'92s in Stateline, Nevada, on the shores of South Lake Tahoe, is where Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and his girlfriend Joan decided to try out Baldwin\'92s system. The men who would later become known as the Four Horsemen of Aberdeen \'96 Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel, and James McDermott \'96 were mathematicians at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and, using clunky electrical/mechanical calculators of the era, perhaps the Friden brand, they had laboriously devised a basic system for the game of blackjack. With the approval of their supervisor, Abe Karp, they had spent several thousand hours over a period of one and one-half years in 1952

\fs32 \cf3 and 1953 working evenings and weekends. Their professional credentials, as well as the intriguing possibility that their system could work, attracted Oakley, Allan ( the one-handed card shuffler), as well as Professor Sorgenfrey and Angus Taylor. I would guess that Professor Taylor would have loved to have made the trip with them, but, future colleagues or not, one has to retain one\'92s distance from students as a tenured professor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The green felt-covered blackjack table, with the name \'93Barney\'92s\'94 printed on it in red ink, included a silvery money tray containing rows of chips, colored according to their value and each emblazoned, of course, with the name \'93Barney\'92s.\'94 Next to it was a discarded pile of cards. The cards were house cards, which is my way of saying they had the name \'93Barney\'92s\'94 printed on them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Phil, the pit boss, stood behind the dealer. In his 50s, his name tag read, \'93Phil.\'94 Joey, a dealer in her 40s, stood behind the table. Her name tag read, \'93Joey.\'94 She was the kind of woman, a bit weathered, more than a bit bored with life, probably single with two or three bratty kids living with her at the trailer camp, who rendered unsupportable any fantasy that the casino dealers had wild sex parties every night after work. Thankfully their shirts did not have \'93Barney\'92s\'94 stitched onto them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Small piles of $1 chips sat on the players\'92 side of the table in front of Allan, Joan, Vivian, and Oakley. Single $1 chips lay in the betting squares at the four players\'92 positions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan, Joan, Vivian, and Oakley sat at the table, clockwise with Allan to the left of the dealer. All wore ski vests. It was an attempt, although poor, at camouflage, because the clean, unbruised, unfrayed condition of the vests made it was obvious that they had never been worn at an actual ski slope. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey dealt two cards to the four players from her left to her right and then to herself, one at a time. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Most of our players bet only one-dollar at a time,\'94 she said to reassure her heavy bettors. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 From her 52-card deck, Joey dealt the eight of Clubs and two of Diamonds to Allan, the seven of Spades and seven of Hearts to Joan, the three of Diamonds and Jack of Spades to Vivian, and the eight of Hearts and three of Hearts to Oakley. Her up card was the King of Hearts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good,\'94 said Allan. \'93I mean, we\'92re feeling so silly.\'94 \'93No problem. Would you like a card?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93I have to get to twenty-one, right?\'94 asked Allan. \'93That\'92s the game.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay, I\'92ll take a card.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan knew the game, of course. They were trying to act as if they were absolute rubes, perhaps friends of Barney, Billy Bob, or Bubba themselves. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey took a card from the discard pile and scratched the green felt of the Barney\'92s table with its edge. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here, you scratch the table. That\'92s the way you tell the dealer you want a card.\'94 \'93Cool,\'94 said Allan. \'93I\'92ll take a card. Oh, sorry.\'94\uc0\u8232 He scratched the table with his finger.\u8232 \'93You idiot,\'94 said Oakley. \'93She meant with the card.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bimbo,\'94 seconded Joan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t feel too stupid,\'94 said the post-doctoral student in mathematics at UCLA. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Phil walked over and stood next to Joey. Maybe he could prevent her from getting a headache. Joey dealt Allan the seven of Diamonds. Allan scratched the table with the card. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92ve got seventeen. That\'92s a pretty good hand,\'94 offered Phil. \'93But I\'92ve got to get to twenty-one. Card please.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh boy,\'94 exclaimed Joey. She dealt Allan the eight of Spades. \'93Sorry. You\'92re over twenty-one.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You wouldn\'92t know it,\'94 said Joan. Joan clearly was as good an actor, if not better, than Allan or Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So I lose?\'94 moaned Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Just be happy you\'92re not playing more than a dollar,\'94 sympathized Phil. Joey took the four cards from Allan\'92s position and placed them in the dis- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 card pile. She took the $1 chip and put it into the silver-lined tray.\uc0\u8232 \'93Bimbo. I\'92m not going to take a card,\'94 said Joan.\u8232 \'93You\'92ve only got fourteen, Joan,\'94 noted Vivian.\u8232 A man, about 40, walked up behind Vivian and watched the game. He was 
\fs24 \

\fs32 slight of build, with sensuous full lips, and his black hair was combed back into a pompadour. He had piercing eyes. His whiskers showed he hadn\'92t shaved in a couple days, and the black dirt under his fingernails showed he had spent a lot of time at the tables during that time. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, but I don\'92t want to go over twenty-one, like Mr. Genius here,\'94 replied Joan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Then, you wave your hand over the cards,\'94 lectured Phil.\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s black magic,\'94 observed Oakley. \'93I knew it.\'94\u8232 \'93You kids crack me up. No, that\'92s the way you tell the dealer you don\'92t want 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a card.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93There\'92s got to be some kind of system to beat this game,\'94 said Allan, the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 naive one.\uc0\u8232 \'93Lots,\'94 answered Phil. \'93Lots. But, kids, when a lamb goes to the slaughter, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the lamb might kill the butcher. But we always bet on the butcher.\'94 \'93Got\'92cha,\'94 replied Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93I\'92m a vegetarian,\'94 Vivian noted.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Ma\'92am?\'94 asked Joey. She wanted to know if Vivian wanted to take a card or stand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m going to do what Joan did,\'94 said Vivian. She waved her hand over the cards. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92ve got thirteen, Vivian. It\'92s bad luck.\'94 Oakley was continuing in the black magic vein. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So I should take a card?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What do you think, Phil?\'94 Oakley was enjoying the role playing. He assumed that the moderate intellects of the dealers and pit bosses could be manipulated. Pit bosses, he was beginning to realize, don\'92t do much except stand around looking knowledgeable and authoritative. Every once in a while they\'92d get on the phone at their station, ostensibly to call to casino management but more likely checking up on the latest sports scores or calling the wife. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I can\'92t advise you kids how to play, you know that,\'94 said Phil, authoritatively. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian waved both of her hands over the table.\uc0\u8232 \'93Abracadabra. I\'92m not taking a card. Final.\'94\u8232 Oakley scratched the table with his cards.\u8232 \'93Is this a great woman? I\'92ll take a card. Can\'92t go over twenty-one if I have 
\fs24 \

\fs32 only eleven.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Finally, a real gambler,\'94 said Phil. At least he had the mental ability for 
\fs24 \

\fs32 sarcasm.\uc0\u8232 Joey delivered the Queen of Hearts to Oakley.\u8232 \'93Blackjack!\'94 Oakley yelled. \'93Read \'91em and weep, my friend!\'94 Oakley was 
\fs24 \

\fs32 obviously really enjoying the role playing.\uc0\u8232 \'93Way to go, Edward,\'94 congratulated Vivian.\u8232 \'93See, he took a card,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 Joey, far from getting the headache that Phil feared, laughed at the antics of 
\fs24 \

\fs32 these obvious neophytes.\uc0\u8232 \'93No, kids. It\'92s a blackjack only if you get twenty-one on the first two cards.\'94 \'93Oh,\'94 said Oakley. \'93What about the flush?\'94 I think Oakley by this time 
\fs24 \

\fs32 was playing too stupid.\uc0\u8232 \'93Flush?\'94 asked Joey.\u8232 \'93Yeah. I\'92ve got three Hearts.\'94\u8232 The 40-year-old gambler had seen enough.\u8232 \'93This is pathetic,\'94 he said.\u8232 \'93Sorry,\'94 said Joey. \'93This isn\'92t poker.\'94\u8232 It\'92s interesting, Oakley would tell me, that years later the casinos developed 
\fs24 \

\fs32 hybrid blackjack/poker games in which bets on poker hands would be accepted as side bets. That time, however, was in the future. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey flipped over her down card to reveal the four of Diamonds. \'93Fourteen,\'94 she said. She dealt herself the seven of Clubs.\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh my God.\'94 Joan\'92s utterance was truthful.\u8232 \'93Twenty-one,\'94 said Joey. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey took the $1 chip from Joan and the $1 chip from Vivian. She placed them in her tray. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey,\'94 said Joan. Even for experienced players, it\'92s hard to dissociate the dealer from the cards dealt. Unless they are cheating dealers, so-called mechanics, the dealer has no effect whatsoever on what cards are dealt when and to whom. Yet, it\'92s human nature, and Joan had trouble believ- ing that such a nice person, as Joey seemed to be, could have pulled a seven of Clubs to reach 21, defeating them both. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We should have taken a card, Joan,\'94 cried Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Push,\'94 Joey said to Oakley. He, too, recall, had a total of twenty-one. \'93Push\'94 is blackjack jargon for a \'93tie.\'94 No money is exchanged. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey scooped up all the cards remaining on the table and put them in her discard pile. The 40-year-old gambler type sat down in the seat to the left of Oakley. He laid a one hundred dollar bill on his position on the table, neatly, in the center of the square where bets are supposed to be placed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Chips?\'94 Joey asked.\uc0\u8232 \'93No,\'94 said the 40-year-old gambler.\u8232 \'93Money plays,\'94 exclaimed Joey. This was one time that the pit boss served 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a purpose.\uc0\u8232 Phil heard this, turned his head, and nodded that he was aware that the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 gambler was actually betting the entire amount rather than asking to buy chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Guys, I don\'92t think we\'92re on the bunny hill anymore,\'94 said Vivian. It was questionable whether they had been on the bunny hill at all. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92d like to keep playing these stakes,\'94 said the 40-year-old gambler to Phil. The message could not have been clearer. Get these college punks off of the table and you\'92ll get some real action. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mr. Marcum would like to play,\'94 said Phil. So, this little dark-haired man with the piercing eyes was really a well-known gambler. The pit boss not only knew his name but referred to him as Mister. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You know,\'94 Phil said to Allan. \'93It\'92s been enjoyable watching you and your friends gamble, but you think you might like some lunch?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, this is fun. We want to keep playing,\'94 said Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Phil went over to his station and reached into a drawer. He pulled out four pieces of paper, walked back to the table, and handed them to Allan.

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Do they have chipped beef?\'94 You know what smart-aleck uttered this. Every college and university cafeteria has chipped beef on their weekly menu. No other restaurant in the civilized or uncivilized world has ever served it. Even Phil knew this.

\fs32 \'93Sure,\'94 replied Phil. \'93And it\'92s probably much better than what you get in the dorms.\'94

\fs32 The use of pleasant background music in the restaurant in Barney\'92s, light, happy, joyous, wasn\'92t accidental. Marketing employed it to prevent those who lost at the tables to lose their enthusiasm for gambling. No one was at the hostess\'92 desk just inside the plastic miniature bougainvillea-decorated entrance to hear Allan, Joan, Vivian, and Oakley laughing hysterically.

\fs32 \'93I\'92m seriously thinking about becoming an actor and giving up law school.\'94 \'93You are?\'94 asked Allan.\uc0\u8232 A young girl, 18 years old or so, approached them, smiling. She wore a blue

\fs32 pastel dress, with a Barney\'92s name tag with the name \'93Shelby\'94 written on it. She fit the background music. She carried an arm full of menus.

\fs32 \'93Four?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93No. Three,\'94 said Allan. \'93He\'92s just the restaurant reviewer.\'94\u8232 I love that. The hostesses always ask the obvious question, and probably for 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the first time in her career she was perplexed. Perhaps she was even stunned. \'93Oh, really,\'94 Shelby said. \'93Let me get the manager.\'94 She walked away. \'93Restaurant reviewer?\'94 asked Vivian. She was obviously as perplexed as 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Shelby.\uc0\u8232 \'93Vivian, this is the way we get the most expensive stuff on the menu for 
\fs24 \

\fs32 free,\'94 noted Allan. \'93Then we use the coupons for dinner.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93But I wanted the chipped beef,\'94 noted Joan, hopefully not telling the truth. \'93That\'92s probably the most expensive thing on the menu,\'94 observed Oakley 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to everyone\'92s laughter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 College students, even graduate students, face economic challenges. I\'92m sure Oakley didn\'92t do this, but he told me stories that as soon as you move out of the dorm into an apartment, the first thing you do is go to the university cafeteria to acquire silverware. Allan\'92s ruse implied that he had not been above such shopping strategies. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Thad, his name judging from his Barney\'92s name tag, approached with Shelby. His suit indicated that he was the aforementioned manager. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen,\'94 he said. \'93What paper or magazine are you with?\'94 He undoubtedly knew from looking at them that the members of the group were college students. They responded in near unison. 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 Thad\'92s decision.\uc0\u8232 \'93So much for acting,\'94 said Oakley.\u8232 \'93But you kids tried, and I\'92m sure you don\'92t have a lot of cash. So, here . . .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Thad reached into his pocket and pulled out four pieces of paper.\uc0\u8232 \'93These are free dinner coupons. You can use them tonight. Just remember 
\fs24 \

\fs32 us when you get rich and famous.\'94 Thad was a good guy.\uc0\u8232 \'93But mathematicians don\'92t get . . .\'94 replied Allan.\u8232 Oakley coughed loudly to drown out Allan. \'93Thank you, thank you, thank you 
\fs24 \

\fs32 so much, Thad.\'94 He peeked at Vivian to see if she had heard Allan\'92s comment. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They had some sandwiches, chipped beef not being on the menu, no doubt to everyone\'92s disappointment. They were having ice cream sundaes. Vivian had asked for extra whipped cream and maraschino cherries, perhaps an unsubtle message to Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley told me that he loved Vivian\'92s name. Not only did he love her first name, he loved her last name, Artisen. She was a creative person by any measure. An English major at UC Berkeley, Cal, as she called it, she also designed fashion and was an accomplished jazz vocalist. Her name, Artisen, although not spelled \'93Artisan,\'94 was nearly a perfect match to her life skills. Her parents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants, her father a businessman and her mother a homemaker. They encouraged her creative leanings, but she didn\'92t think her talents were inherited, the only musical talent evident in the Artisen household being her father\'92s harmonica playing. He particularly liked

\fs24 \

\fs32 She and Oakley, the mathematician, would permute the letters of her name to see what they would spell. Then they\'92d come up with stories about the word or phrase. The game had started early in their dating, when Oakley had scraped up enough cash to take her to a Frank Sinatra appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. They realized that the letters of \'93Sinatra\'94 and \'93Artisen\'94 were identical except for switching her \'93e\'94 for one of his \'93a\'92s.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 With three vowels, and four of the most commonly appearing consonants in materials printed in the English alphabet \'96 \'93n,\'94 \'93r,\'94 \'93s,\'94 \'96 and \'93t\'94 many words would result from the permutations. In fact, the most frequently appearing letters in the English alphabet are e-t-a-o-n-r-i-s-h. Of the first eight, Vivian\'92s name only lacked the \'93o.\'94 Oakley, with enthusiastic Vivian\'92s help, enjoyed playing the word game. They called it \'93The Vivian Name Game.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They came up with dozens. Some of their favorites were: 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Senitar, provided on the application of someone from the hills of West Virginia for political office. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Air nets, missile defense system of Nationalicwz Militariczskicz Polski. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Air nets, (or . . . ) National Security Agency installation in the atmosphere above Roswell, New Mexico. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Ranites, extinct tribe of bush people who were compulsive joggers. 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 Is a tern, answer to the question, \'93Look! Is it an eagle, an albatross, a condor, or a pterodactyl?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Ranties, a small cloth, in mint, chocolate, or bubble-gum flavors, to insert into the mouths of screaming, belligerent children. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Rise-Tan, a product which today would be banned as carcinogenic. Ran SETI, astronomer Frank Drake.\uc0\u8232 Sir Ante, the nickname of the King of poker players.\u8232 Arsenit, the smallest amount that will make you ill. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Its near, after hiding in the basement, they sensed the approach of the alien. Rise Nat, what Guinevere said to the newly knighted Sir Nat.\uc0\u8232 Sear tin, ethical disclosure the surgeon had to tell the Tin Man before his

\fs24 \

\fs32 Ra Nites, ancient, mystical Egyptian evening celebration honoring the Sun god. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Tin ears, the result of getting a transplant from a character in the \'93Wizard of Oz.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Wait. They came up with many more, including:\uc0\u8232 Ne a stir, Middle English for a quiet night.\u8232 E trains, one of the subway transit lines in New York City for which Billy 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Strayhorn did not write a jazz piece.\uc0\u8232 Sir Nate, the familiar name for Nathaniel, an obscure knight of the Round

\fs24 \

\fs32 playing this game. I wrote down this list to show you that mom did indeed love Oakley and his mind and Oakley did indeed love mom. A few dozen more are presented at the end of the story. Oakley wouldn\'92t have wanted the narrative to get cluttered. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Tomorrow, at the crack of dawn, I play Baldwin\'92s system,\'94 announced Oakley as they finished their ice cream sundaes. \'93They think we\'92re just kids. I wrote the strategy down on a little card, and they\'92ll think I\'92m just another nut with a doomed system. They won\'92t suspect anything. I\'92ll report at breakfast.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93How\'92d you find out about it?\'94 asked Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93One of Edward\'92s professors,\'94 said Allan. Vivian was starting to ask some uncomfortable questions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A law school professor?\'94 Vivian was puzzled. How could a law school professor become knowledgeable about gambling systems?

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Uh, sure. He teaches . . . uh, criminal law,\'94 Oakley said, coming to Allan\'92s rescue, who was trying to rescue Oakley. \'93Oh what a web we weave,\'94 you know. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What?\'94 said a puzzled Allan, not knowing into which part of the web Oakley was headed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, yeah, sure. Criminal, sure. It\'92s always a chance you take when you commit a crime, you know. A game of chance.\'94 Oakley\'92s laugh did not hide the small beads of sweat forming just above his eyebrows. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I guess,\'94 said Vivian. If Allan and Oakley were truly intelligent they must have known that Vivian was purposely giving them an easy out. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Like we say, commit the crime and do the time,\'94 as Oakley continued with the masquerade. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward, tonight\'92s the night, right?\'94 asked Allan, issuing an order more than a question. He had probably had enough of the charade. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You mean, you guys . . . ,\'94 asked an incredulous Joan.\uc0\u8232 \'93No personal questions for my good friend,\'94 cautioned Allan.\u8232 \'93Thank you for respecting that, Allan.\'94 Oakley was relieved that the inter- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 rogation had changed its course.\uc0\u8232 \'93But, tonight is the night, right Edward?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Before Oakley even thought about blackjack seriously, he knew intuitively that you don\'92t sleep where you gamble. An old expression says you \'93don\'92t ____ where you eat,\'94 meaning don\'92t perform any unseemly acts aimed at, or especially with, fellow employees if you want to keep your job. Professional gamblers, unless they are severely ego-deprived, know that the less the house knows about you the better. If you\'92re a big player and stay in their hotel, they\'92ll get your credit card number and check your credit, see if you\'92re a big spender, meaning in their terms, a high roller, determine if you like to have women in your room, and get a list of who you speak to on the phone. And that\'92s just within an hour of checking in. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If you gamble at Barney\'92s, in other words, don\'92t stay in their rooms. That\'92s why Oakley was giving Vivian a massage in their room at Harrah\'92s. Allan and Joan were down the hall. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The room had two Queen-sized beds, a 21-inch RCA color television, whose multitude of dials intrigued my father, and a compact refrigerator in which they had placed a small bottle of cabernet sauvignon for a gentle night- cap. Vivian sat in a chair in front of a large oblong mirror with what appeared to be genuine oak sculpted frame. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In a demure pink nightgown and robe, Vivian combed her hair when the pleasure of Oakley\'92s shoulder massage allowed. He wore a shirt, untucked, and jeans. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Left. Down. Little more. Ahh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good, good. Ahh, yeah.\'94 Vivian was obviously enjoying the massage. She leaned her head back towards Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Allan talked about \'91is tonight the night?\'92 What d\'92ya got planned, stranger?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As an undergraduate at Cornell, Oakley had bought a Honda 50 for the ride to campus from his apartment. It was at the end of Glen Place, on the ground floor of a house close to the Cascadilla Creek gorge north of East Buffalo Street down the hill from College Town. He had never been a motorcycle kind of guy, but two of the fellows in his Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity, Dan Stern and Stern\'92s lifetime pal Ron Schendel, both had Triumph scooters, and they saved valuable class commute time, otherwise wasted in walking from the campus to the dis- tant fraternity house. Stern became a successful engineering businessman and mayor of Hermosa Beach, and Schendel became a successful engineering con- sultant. One day Schendel had given him a ride back to the fraternity house on his Triumph and Oakley was sold. It wasn\'92t that dangerous after all. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 One winter, Oakley had to lift his bike over a snow bank and wrenched his back. It never fully healed. At UCLA, he exacerbated the muscle spasms one day playing in a softball game. He was rounding third, took a step, and \'96 wham! \'96 the spasm hit. The next day the Bruin band had a concert, and the expansion of his chest and back while playing the trumpet made the spasms worse. The next morning he literally could not get out of bed. It took him an hour just to get up to go to the bathroom. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He spent the next two months getting massages at the campus clinic three times each week. He learned the technique. First, you apply hot towels. Then you spread over a lotion to reduce any friction. Then you use your index finger and middle finger to bore into the spasm, loosening it. Then the masseuse would search for another knot. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He was well prepared to give Vivian any kind of massage she needed. The stress of the gambling, forcing her to be part of the deception, had tightened her up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What d\'92ya got planned, stranger?\'94 she repeated. \'93Nothing.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, what did Allan mean by \'91tonight\'92s the night?\'92\'94 \'93I don\'92t know.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward, what did Allan mean by \'91tonight\'92s the night?\'92\'94 Vivian was not to be deterred. Either it was something significant in their relationship, or it was going to be kinky, and she wasn\'92t quite sure if he had the skills for that or,

\fs32 \cf3 if he did, if she was interested in participating, extra whipped cream and maraschino cherries notwithstanding. Mom was a classy gal. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t know.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Edward.\'94 Maybe kinky wouldn\'92t be so bad.\u8232 Oakley knew it was time. A better time there would never be. It had to be 
\fs24 \

\fs32 done. If he reported to Allan that he hadn\'92t confessed, Allan might spill the beans, and Oakley feared Vivian would never forgive him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay. . . .,\'94 he began, taking a deep breath. He continued as rapidly as he could, to minimize the pain. Perhaps, he hoped, Vivian wouldn\'92t catch on. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, fifty-two times fifty-one times fifty times forty-nine times forty-eight is about fifty to the fifth. I know that five to the fourth is six hundred and twenty-five, so to get five to the fifth multiply by another factor of ten and divide by two. That gives about six thousand divided by two, or three thou- sand. Use scientific notation. That\'92s three times ten to the third. Multiply that by the tens, ten to the fifth, and you have three times ten to the eighth. Five factorial is easy, it\'92s six times twenty, or one hundred and twenty. About ten to the second. So three times ten to the eighth divided by ten to the second is three times ten to the sixth, or three million. And I reduced it by about fifteen percent because I underestimated the numerator and five factorial is one hundred and twenty and not one hundred.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You did that in two seconds?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was astonished at this reaction. Vivian showed no anger, apparently just admiration. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I was slow, I know,\'94 said a relieved Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93So you are a math freak. A monster.\'94\u8232 Oakley put up his hands, curling his fingers toward her. He lifted his head 
\fs24 \

\fs32 and bared his teeth. Vivian had never seen this before.\uc0\u8232 \'93Don\'92t ever, ever call me a monster. Or I will eat your succulent flesh. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Bwwaaaahhhhh!!\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Ten to the whatever. You\'92re a math person. You\'92re a grad student in math, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 aren\'92t you?\'94 Apparently she wasn\'92t alarmed that her boyfriend might also be a ghoulish vampire. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah.\'94 There. If there was any doubt, the truth was out.\uc0\u8232 \'93The lawyer?\'94\u8232 \'93I lied.\'94\u8232 Vivian rose from the vanity and moved to the bed. She slid under the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 sheets.\uc0\u8232 \'93Damn!\'94 thought Oakley. \'93It\'92s over. Now she\'92ll tell me to sleep in the other 
\fs24 \

\fs32 bed. Damn!\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah, I knew that,\'94 Vivian said from under the sheets. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure.\'94 Oakley really didn\'92t know how to respond. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The UCLA law school has a phone number. And although I\'92m just an English major I know how to use a phone. They taught us how in my senior seminar.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh no! I didn\'92t count on that!\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93I even found out the title of your doctoral dissertation.\'94\u8232 \'93You did?\'94\u8232 \'93Something about \'91linear operators.\'92 I don\'92t remember the rest because that 
\fs24 \

\fs32 term itself is such a turn-on.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93It is?!\'94 Thankfully, it appeared the crisis had passed.\u8232 \'93So why did you lie?\'94\u8232 \'93Then, maybe not,\'94 Oakley reconsidered to himself.\u8232 Emboldened, or alarmed, he wasn\'92t sure which, he sat on the side of her 
\fs24 \

\fs32 bed.\uc0\u8232 \'93I didn\'92t want to lose you.\'94\u8232 \'93I\'92m five foot three, one hundred and fifteen pounds. I\'92m not that easy to 
\fs24 \

\fs32 lose,\'94 Vivian noted.\uc0\u8232 \'93Ah, great,\'94 thought Oakley. \'93She\'92s playing along. I\'92m safe. That was easy!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now it was time to open up, show his vulnerability.\uc0\u8232 \'93Ever since I moved to L.A., I\'92ve found the women are only interested in 
\fs24 \

\fs32 you if you\'92re a lawyer or a doctor. I faint when I get a shot, so I chose lawyer.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward, I live in Berkeley.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93You do!?\'94\u8232 Vivian slammed a pillow into his face and pushed him down on the bed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She buried his face in the pillow. Oakley didn\'92t fight, ability to breathe or not. \'93I\'92m going to suffocate you unless you apologize.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93For what?\'94 he muffled from under the pillow.\u8232 \'93For lying to me, you jerk.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I apologize,\'94 still muffled. Vivian had no remorse for the murder she was contemplating. She kept the pillow over his face. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Help! Help!\'94 you could hear the poor muffled voice yell. \'93Call the con- stable! Please, someone call the constable! When Allan and Joan come for wine they\'92ll have you arrested for murder. Help! Help!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They won\'92t be here for another half an hour. Plenty of time for my getaway. I\'92ll be in Dodge by dawn. I\'92m going to suffocate you unless you tell me you\'92ll never lie to me again.\'94 At least, she had given him a way of avoiding death before he reached the age of thirty. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ll never lie to you again,\'94 the muffled voice said. \'93I promise to tell the truth.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93I\'92m going to suffocate you unless you tell me you love me.\'94 The stakes were getting higher. Oakley had to reconsider. He thought of one of the greatest laugh lines in radio history, when Jack Benny faced a robber, \'93Your money or your life!\'94 Benny paused, and the robber repeated, \'93Look, bud! I said your money or your life!\'94 After a short pause, Benny said, \'93I\'92m thinking it over.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley wondered if he should tell Vivian he loves her or get suffocated. The muffled voice tried the sympathy ploy. \'93I can\'92t breathe. I think I\'92m dying.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 I wonder if my father, contemplating his premature demise, thought lovingly of his parents Josie and Oakley Glenn, or of the first kiss he may have received in kindergarten at the Dever elementary school in Chicago, or of his first elegant high school geometry proof, or if he simply regretted not having performed a background check on Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m going to suffocate you unless you tell me you love me,\'94 Vivian repeated. \'93Gurgle, gurgle, dying . . . end . . . is . . . near.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93I\'92m going to suffocate you unless you tell me you love me, Edward.\'94\u8232 \'93I . . . love . . . gurgle gurgle . . . gasp . . . . ,\'94 said the muffled voice with 
\fs24 \

\fs32 apparently its last breath.\uc0\u8232 Vivian removed the pillow so she could clearly hear his final word.\u8232 \'93You.\'94\u8232 \'93Yeah, I knew that,\'94 she said, throwing the pillow on the floor and pulling

\fs32 him towards her.

\fs42\fsmilli21333 Graveyard Shift 
\f1\b0\fs24 \cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Joey and Phil were working the graveyard shift at Barney\'92s. Joey was at a table different from that of the previous day, but in the same pit. In South Lake Tahoe, some of the skiers/gamblers would gamble before the slopes opened. After sundown, unless you were skiing at a location with night lights, the ski- ers would go to their hotels or lodges, sit by the fire, have some hot cider or rum, and then take their shower. After dinner they\'92d hit the tables. Those were the skiers who would gamble for diversion. Those who hit the tables before the slopes opened were the gamblers who would also ski. The casinos are aware of the difference, and are accustomed to seeing full tables even before the graveyard shift was over, usually 7:00 a.m. It was now about 6:15 a.m. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Three players were at the table, along with Oakley. He sat to the right of Joey, in what is called \'93third base.\'94 That allowed him to see all the cards that were discarded by losing players before he had to make his playing strategy decisions. That should have been a tip-off to Phil that this was not the rube they believed they had met the previous day. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Judging from the piles of chips in front of them and the number of chips in their betting squares, none of the other players was a either a high roller or a big winner. Five $5 chips lay on the table in front of the player directly to Joey\'92s left, in \'93first base,\'94 and four $5 chips lay in front of the player to his left. Each had bet two $5 chips. Four $1 chips lay in the betting square of the player directly to Oakley\'92s right. He had no chips remaining other than those. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, in contrast, was playing only $1 chips. Fourteen $1 chips lay on the table in front of him, and he had placed only two $1 chips in his betting square. If he was trying to deflect any suspicion, his playing only $1 chips and

\fs32 \cf3 his low betting would probably do it. The time had not yet come when someone suspected of being a player using a system would be ejected, no matter the size of his bank and the bet. Again, Oakley intuitively must have known to keep his bets low. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Ten assorted cards lay face-up on the table in a jumbled pile. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The Queen of Hearts, three of Diamonds, and seven of Spades lay face-up on the table in front of Joey. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey scooped up the cards on the table and put them in the discard pile. She picked up all the chips that had been bet and inserted them into the money slot next to her on the blackjack table. Both she and Phil were somewhat sur- prised to see Oakley up in the morning. From his play the previous day, they would have guessed he was a skier who found gambling a diversion. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Twenty,\'94 announced Joey. \'93Sorry, fellas.\'94\uc0\u8232 The player next to Oakley rose up from the table.\u8232 \'93You\'92re too tough for me, Joey,\'94 he congratulated her as he walked away, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 completely wiped out.\uc0\u8232 \'93Better luck next time,\'94 she encouraged him. We never really found out, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 but it seems to me that the more action a dealer generates the better chance she has of ever getting promoted to pit boss, or to the security room, if that would be considered a promotion. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re doing much better than yesterday,\'94 said Joey, pointing at Oakley\'92s pile of chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bets,\'94 she said to all the players at the table, pointing her finger and rotat- ing her hand from left to right. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The players sitting in the first two positions placed two $5 chips in their betting squares. Oakley placed two $1 chips in his betting square. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I was up all night studying technique. I think I got a very satisfying system,\'94 answered Oakley. Joey looked at him, having no idea of the 
\f2\i double entendre
\f1\i0 . 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He lifted his left hand to display the index card on which he had written Baldwin\'92s system. \'93See.\'94 Oakley\'92s methodical, measured play and his contin- ual referring to the card in his palm had attracted a small group of amused bystanders. Some smirked at his comment. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Beginning at her left, Joey dealt a card to each player and then herself, all face down. She then dealt a second card to each player, face down. She dealt the six of Clubs to herself, face up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We had a guy come in here with a system and he walked out with a thousand,\'94 countered Phil. \'93You know how? He came in with two.\'94 Oakley nodded agreement to the pit boss. This only confirmed his assessment that pit bosses did very little on the phone other than talk to their wives. This one, at least, seemed oblivious to any possibility of a system being developed for the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 game, the system, for example, of Baldwin and his colleagues that Oakley was testing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, systems players,\'94 Phil continued, smirking. \'93We love system players. We send cabs to pick \'91em up.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The player in the first seat thought he had a pat hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I stand,\'94 he told Joey. \'93The only system is the one named Lady Luck, my friend,\'94 he lectured Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley would have expected a statement of such abysmal ignorance. By sitting in the first seat, the player prevented himself from seeing any cards that had been dealt and discarded from hands that had busted. He lost the opportunity to make the more informed playing strategy decisions that could be achieved by sitting further around the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The other remaining player, a man about Oakley\'92s age but with the rough, reddened hands of a local farmer or farmhand hitting the tables before going to work, scratched the table with his two cards. Joey dealt him the ten of Hearts. He flipped over his two cards to reveal the nine of Diamonds and six of Diamonds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m almost wiped out,\'94 he twanged. \'93You\'92re just too hot, Joey.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Young Old McDonald picked up his remaining two chips, stood up, stared at his chips sitting on the table, about to be scooped up, and left the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Better luck next time,\'94 said Joey to the fellow, knowing he\'92d be back. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley turned over his cards to reveal the nine of Spades and nine of Clubs. He placed a second pair of chips on top of the nine of Clubs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Man, you got an eighteen,\'94 the first player raised his voice to Oakley. \'93You don\'92t split up an eighteen.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I still have a lot to learn,\'94 as he excused his poor playing strategy to the player. \'93Starting with the A, B, C\'92s of it.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Staring at Oakley, Joey dealt the seven of Clubs next to Oakley\'92s nine of Spades and five of Diamonds next to his nine of Clubs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, man. You had a pat hand and you blew it away,\'94 observed the player to Joey\'92s left, sitting at first base. \'93Now you got crap.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. I guess I\'92d better stand on both.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey flipped over her down card to reveal the Jack of Clubs, giving her a total of 16. With less than 17, the rules of blackjack stated that she, as the dealer, had to take a hit. She dealt herself the seven of Spades, for a total of twenty-three. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dealer busts,\'94 she announced.\uc0\u8232 \'93Talk about good luck!\'94 exclaimed Oakley.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yeah,\'94 said the player at first base. \'93Just don\'92t do that again, man. You don\'92t know squat about this game, man.\'94 He pointed to Oakley\'92s index card. \'93And your system ain\'92t worth a plugged nickel.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was slightly annoyed with this fellow and his use of jazz lingo in referring to him. If he had known anything about jazz he would have shown some recognition at Oakley\'92s having quoted a lyric from the standard \'93Teach Me Tonight.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey flipped over the cards of the self-anointed expert player to reveal the Ace of Clubs and seven of Diamonds. He had a soft 18. She paid out two $1 chips to each of Oakley\'92s hands and two $5 chips to the player with the soft 18. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You both win,\'94 she said as she scooped up all the cards on the table and put them in the discard pile. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You know,\'94 said Phil, who was observing the action. \'93I don\'92t usually give advice, but eighteen is a pat hand.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I never was very good in school,\'94 said the fellow who had earned the bach- elor\'92s, gaining election to Phi Beta Kappa, and master\'92s degree in physics before embarking on Ph.D studies in mathematics. \'93Thanks for the tip,\'94 he added. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The first player moved all his seven $5 chips into his betting square while Oakley again moved two $1 chips into his betting square. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Double or nothin\'92,\'94 the player announced. \'93What an outstanding betting move,\'94 Oakley said to himself. \'93This guy must be playing a very, very sophisti- cated system.\'94 Oakley looked at him with the disdain that only a mathematics genius could direct at someone he considered a registered rube. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey dealt a card to mister know-it-all, Oakley, and herself, all face down. She dealt a second card to each player, face down, and then she dealt the Ace of Diamonds, to herself, face up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Damn,\'94 said the player, ruing the moment he opted for his new betting strategy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joey lifted up one corner of her down card slightly, stared at it for a moment or two, and then flipped it over to reveal the King of Clubs. Oakley wondered about the motivation for the drama. Did she have a bad night and wanted to get revenge on the world or at least on two of its inhabitants by prolonging the torture by this imposed anticipation, or did she feel some sympathy for the two players? 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sorry, fellas,\'94 said Joey. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re killing me, honey,\'94 said the know-it-all loser, with what Oakley was not surprised was a condescending attitude toward at least this woman. He rose from the table. \'93You\'92re killing me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley thought, \'93The dealer has nothing to do with it, 
\f2\i man
\f1\i0 .\'94 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and Joan sat at a table in Barney\'92s restaurant for the breakfast appointment at which they would hear the tales of Oakley\'92s gambling experiment. Four place settings were on the table, silverware, plates, and glasses of water. The non-stop pleasant music played. A waitress, who, judging from her name tag with the name \'93Janyce,\'94 would lead to even money saying she was the hostess Shelby\'92s sister, stood at the table holding an order pad and pencil. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And two scrambled eggs with hashed browns 
\f2\i au gratis
\f1\i0 ,\'94 Allan told the waitress. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93
\f2\i Au gratin
\f1\i0 ,\'94 Vivian corrected him.\uc0\u8232 \'93
\f2\i Au gratis
\f1\i0 ,\'94 he repeated.\uc0\u8232 \'93It worked once,\'94 explained Joan to Vivian. It was the silverware bandit 
\fs24 \

\fs32 trying for another handout. Oakley told me that Allan, despite the wealth he would accumulate later in life, would continue to play such games. Very bright people with a playful leaning employ such manipulation games, more for the neuron-to-neuron mental challenge with intellectual inferiors than any monetary gain. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93He stood on soft eighteen against a six,\'94 said Oakley, still considering the hands he had seen played. \'93Baldwin\'92s tables say he should have doubled down.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Did you want to order?\'94 asked Janyce the waitress. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93These so-called good players have no knowledge of the game. They really think that the cards and the dice and the wheel get hot! They play based on ignorance and superstition.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Like tapping the table with a chip for good luck,\'94 agreed Joan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Even we learned that trying not to go over twenty-one won\'92t succeed,\'94 added Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So you were the only gunslinger left standing, huh?\'94 asked Allan. The poor waitress was being completely ignored. At this point she probably was thinking that these people were so unaware of her presence that they\'92d prob- ably not give her a tip. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I came in with $10 and I left with $18.50,\'94 reported Oakley in mock 
\f2\i braggadocio
\f1\i0 . 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93My hero,\'94 said Vivian, kissing him on the cheek.\uc0\u8232 \'93Baldwin\'92s system works,\'94 was Oakley\'92s final, official report.\u8232 \'93Did you want to order?\'94 asked the waitress. She had probably not read the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 paper in the 
\f2\i Journal of the American Statistical Association.\uc0\u8232 
\f1\i0 \'93Very interesting,\'94 noted Allan. \'93But guess who\'92s picking up the tab.\'94 \'93Sorry,\'94 Oakley said to the waitress. \'93For me, uh, also two scrambled eggs, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 orange juice, and a blueberry muffin. Easy on the amaretto-cinnamon-walnut hollandaise sauce supreme.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Janyce the waitress stared at him. 
\f2\i Maybe these guys were on drugs, 
\f1\i0 she may have been thinking. Oakley wondered if she had ever, or would ever, enjoy a hollandaise sauce. He hoped she would. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Looks like this food thing is contagious,\'94 said Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93I was just a big winner at the tables,\'94 he explained to a bewildered Janyce. The waitress walked away. It\'92s a sad commentary, Oakley thought, that 
\fs24 \

\fs32 so many living in rural areas have little to do except hunt and procreate. Once they\'92ve procreated, they have plenty of time to consider names for the new baby. Shelby and Janyce apparently came from such a background. Their father probably never thought that the animal he had most recently killed may have been the father or mother of a child who was also joyfully antici- pated and dearly loved. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Enough gambling talk,\'94 pronounced Vivian. \'93I have an important announcement to make.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh?\'94 asked Joan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Edward told me last night he\'92s not really a law student.\'94\u8232 \'93Way to go, Edward,\'94 Allan congratulated him. \'93Finally.\'94\u8232 \'93I don\'92t know why he\'92s so ashamed of being in med school.\'94 Oakley\'92s jaw 
\fs24 \

\fs32 fell open and he stared at Vivian in disbelief and new-found admiration that she was going to continue the masquerade. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Med school?\'94 inquired Joan, staring at Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93That\'92s right. And I feel so good finally getting it off my chest.\'94\u8232 \'93I guess it must be a good feeling,\'94 said Allan. \'93Right, Edward?\'94\u8232 \'93Yep.\'94\u8232 \'93Well, Edward,\'94 Joan thought she\'92d best be careful here. \'93Uh. What are 
\fs24 \

\fs32 you going to specialize in?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93He told me he\'92s going to be a surgeon, right, Edward?\'94\u8232 \'93Yep. A surgeon. Brain, heart, elbows, you name it.\'94\u8232 \'93He\'92s going to do operations,\'94 Vivian gleamed. \'93He\'92s going to be the world\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 greatest linear operator.\'94 She laughed at her joke making. She was obviously pleased at having confused her friends. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You bum,\'94 Allan said to Oakley. \'93I\'92m going to kill ya\'92.\'94 \'93Is she the greatest? Is she or is she not the greatest?\'94 \'93That\'92s why he proposed last night,\'94 explained Vivian. \'93I did? My head must have been in a cloud.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Professor of Mathematics and Mrs. Edward Oakley Thorp,\'94 Vivian mock imagined their being introduced to society. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And I said \'91Yes.\'92 I\'92m so happy.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93With these guys you don\'92t know what to believe,\'94 observed Joan.\u8232 \'93It\'92s part of his penance for lying to me,\'94 further explained the bride-to-be. \'93See,\'94 Oakley bemoaned his fate. \'93This is why men choose celibacy.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 It was barely 10:00 a.m. when they walked out of Barney\'92s. Although it was January, it was a temperate 48\'b0 in South Lake Tahoe. The Sun helped, and its rays shone into their eyes. The ski operators weren\'92t complaining. The roads were clear, and the temperature dove as you ascended through the gradually thinning air into the mountains. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 No slot machines stood on the sidewalk outside the door, but three \'93Your Money or Your Life\'94 brand vending machines were planted there. Guaranteed 100% sugar candy of various colors were in one. Souvenir trin- kets were in the second, and the ever-present peanuts in the shell with a surprise gift were in the third. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Check-out time is in two hours. If this is going to get done, we\'92ve got to work in teams.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Get what done?\'94 asked Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Our wedding,\'94 said Vivian. It\'92s hard to tell if she was continuing the joke or getting peeved at Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You guys weren\'92t kidding?\'94 Joan came to the aid of her boyfriend. \'93I said \'91Yes,\'92 \'94 Oakley reminded them.\uc0\u8232 \'93How romantic,\'94 said Allan, still perhaps in disbelief.\u8232 \'93I didn\'92t even have to get down on my knees,\'94 said Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93She suffocated me with love.\'94 If it\'92s not obvious by now, my parents cared for each other and found joy in their relationship. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What a sweet, lovely story for the children,\'94 noted Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No ring!? You just won $8.50.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93I picked up the entire tab.\'94\u8232 \'93We need rings,\'94 Vivian demanded.\u8232 Oakley stared at the vending machines.\u8232 \'93Okay,\'94 he relented. \'93Who\'92s got change?\'94\u8232 Allan, the consummate soon-to-be-designated best man, dug in his pocket 
\fs24 \

\fs32 for change and came up with a few dollar bills.\uc0\u8232 \'93Couple dollars,\'94 he announced. Oakley opened up his wallet and gleefully 
\fs24 \

\fs32 displayed a few dimes and nickels.\uc0\u8232 \'93Bunch of nickels and dimes,\'94 he said. He walked over to the vending 
\fs24 \

\fs32 machines and stared at the one containing the trinkets.\uc0\u8232 \'93This one. Perfect.\'94\u8232 He put a dime in the slot and pulled the lever. A large pink gumball rolled out. \'93How about this?\'94 he said to Vivian. \'93Pink. We could hollow it out.\'94 Oakley 
\fs24 \

\fs32 was suddenly interested in jewelry design.\uc0\u8232 \'93That\'92s good with me,\'94 she said. \'93I want a divorce.\'94 Of course, she was 
\fs24 \

\fs32 kidding. You can\'92t get a divorce if you\'92re not yet married. On the other hand, if they had been married, perhaps this would have been grounds for dissolution. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley put another dime in the slot and pulled the lever. Another large gumball rolled out. He looked at Vivian, who wagged her head \'93No.\'94 He put in another dime and pulled the lever. A key chain rolled out. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 yelled Oakley triumphantly. \'93That\'92s one.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all laughed at Oakley\'92s mock triumph. Yet, the key chain would have to do. He placed a fourth dime in the slot and pulled the lever. A pair of fuzzy dice rolled out. They were colored red with white dots. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well,\'94 Allan said. \'93That\'92s for good luck.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93What if they\'92re loaded?\'94 asked Oakley.\u8232 \'93I\'92m content with a single-ring ceremony, Edward,\'94 said Vivian. If they 
\fs24 \

\fs32 really were going to do the necessary groundwork, get married, and check out of Harrah\'92s before noon, they couldn\'92t spend any more time playing vending machine roulette. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay with me,\'94 said Oakley, apparently resigned to having a single-ring ceremony. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re the best man,\'94 he said to Allan. This was not the greatest surprise. \'93Okay with me,\'94 he agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Allan and I will take the car,\'94 Oakley directed. \'93You guys scour these streets. We meet back here in an hour. Soldiers, synchronize your watches. Did we for- get anything?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The guest list, the bridal registry, the invitations, the menu, the center- pieces, the seating arrangements, the orchestra, music for the first dance, and rice,\'94 offered Vivian, knowing that none of those embellishments would be realized. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Rice,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Right.\'94 Oakley, if you recall, was a smart-aleck. He looked at his wristwatch. \'93Fifty-nine minutes.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley decided that the nuptials would be held in the Royal Garden Wedding Chapel. He and Allan had passed a number of chapels, and one can be sure that they all offered the same spiritually fulfilling, righteous, respectful, and, most importantly, statute-satisfying wedding service, suitable for all faiths, although they all would only be about ten minutes long. The cost would be about the same at any of them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As soon as Oakley saw the name, however, he announced his choice. \'93Royal Garden\'94 didn\'92t appeal to him because of any pretensions toward monarchs and their accoutrements and fawning serfs, but rather because Royal Gardens Blues was the first tune played by the high school dance band in which he had first played jazz. He could still scat sing the tune, \'93dah, da da da da dot dot dot, de dah dah, da da da da dot dot dot.\'94 A simple little blues ditty; it was perfect for a high school dance band just starting out, and Oakley found that it remained in his brain, waiting for a reprise at any par- ticularly unoccupied moment. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The dance band was led by a bookish kid from the concert band who played the sax, and his concept of putting together a dance band for sock hops wasn\'92t to get any gigs but to put on a concert. Every week on a Sunday afternoon, the guys would get together at his house and rehearse a couple tunes. He only had a couple of arrangements, or charts, as jazz players call them. Royal Garden Blues was the first tune they\'92d rehearse every Sunday. They had it down pat, but the band never got any gigs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley decided this nice bandleader was a lousy businessman, and so he formed his own band. He actually bought some charts and within weeks got booked not only for the sock hops in the basement of the First Baptist Church the evenings of Saturday afternoon football games but also a couple private parties and a wedding. Yes, The Deuces, composed of high school kids, got a booking for a wedding.

\fs32 \cf3 The bass player in the band would become a music major in college and get hired by the New York Philharmonic, with whom he would gain renown for not only his musicianship but also for his bringing jazz to the composi- tion of orchestral pieces. His father was an artist and painted their music stands white with red and black sketches of two overlapping playing cards, the deuce of Hearts over the deuce of Spades. Oakley taught Jon how to play pizzicato, using the fingers to pluck the strings instead of the bow and Jon would use such an embellishment in his compositions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Royal Garden, it was obvious, meant a lot to Oakley, and he decided instantaneously that he and Vivian would get married there, even it meant scat singing the tune in his head for the entire ride back to L.A. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Walking inside, the first thing that Oakley and Allan saw was the pulpit. Tastefully done, it was a six-inch platform surrounded by a white picket trel- lis on which white roses and green vine climbed. Actually, the white roses and green vine would have climbed there, but plastic does not grow, let alone climb. The second thing they saw was a sign bordered with plastic white roses read- ing \'93Love the Lord.\'94 The white roses must have signified virginity, they real- ized. The third thing they saw was a sign behind the pulpit reading \'93The Royal Garden Heavenly Harmony Chapel. $25. Cash only. No checks, money orders, or Green Stamps. Pastor Elmer, Clergyman.\'94 An organ stood next to the pulpit. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley couldn\'92t figure out the reason for the words \'93heavenly harmony\'94 in the name. Maybe the pastor felt that the harmonies of the Royal Garden Blues were presented by none other than the Lord. Oakley made a mental note to tell the pastor that in fact the blues progression was the blues progression, and that the harmonies were made by Louie Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and the composers for Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and others. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A man, no doubt Pastor Elmer, and a woman stood in front of the pulpit and waved hello to Oakley and Allan. The good pastor wore cowboy boots. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The wife Alice and I have presided over many marriages,\'94 he said in a mild country and western twang, gesturing to his wife. \'93But it\'92s usually, well, between a man and a woman.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93As long as they love the Lord, Elmer dear,\'94 sang Alice, in her own country and western twang. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yes,\'94 he agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You 
\f2\i do 
\f1\i0 love the Lord?\'94 inquired Alice with a steely yet affectionate glare. It was beyond her understanding that anyone could in fact not love the Lord. 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 At about the same time, a few hundred yards from Harrah\'92s, Vivian and Joan had found a florist shop. They stood in front of a refrigerated flower case. Her hair teased in a high bouffant, a salesgirl, in her 30s, stood next to them. She wore black lipstick and large earrings. She chewed gum. Her name tag indi- cated her name to be Infinity. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If you want a love that will last for eternity,\'94 Infinity said looking straight into their eyes, \'93I always suggest the lilies from Roswell, New Mexico.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She moved sufficiently close that she forced Vivian to retreat a step, trans- mitted her less than pleasing body scent into Vivian\'92s nostrils, and allowed Vivian to examine her moustache. She whispered, the reason no doubt for the close encounter, looked from side to side to ensure that no one who might consider doing her harm could hear her, and opened her eyes wide. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They were planted by the aliens.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A sign on the wall of the musky tailor shop read, \'93Eisenberg and Goldstein, Your Old Country Tailors. Kibitzing Allowed.\'94 Unfortunately, neither Oakley nor Allan had time for kibitzing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was draped in a white shirt, red bow tie, black tuxedo jacket with black silk trim, and black tuxedo pants. Several inches of the end of the pants legs lay on the floor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The tailor, a man about fifty years old knelt in front of Oakley. A yellow cloth measuring tape and extraordinarily large faux gold crucifix hung around his neck. He held a thin bar of soap. Allan stood next to him. The tailor stood up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93First, Stanley telling tailor joke,\'94 he said.\uc0\u8232 \'93Stanley, we\'92re in a real rush,\'94 Allan pleaded.\u8232 \'93Stanley telling joke to all peoples. You want working?\'94 Stanley had them

\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, waiter is asked \'91what\'92s this fly doing in my soup?\'92 Tailor is asked \'91what\'92s this soup doing in my fly?\'92\'94 explained Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yah, that being right. Good joke, huh?\'94 cried Stanley. \'93My joke.\'94 \'93Yeah, good joke,\'94 sighed Allan.

\fs32 \cf3 Stanley realized, undoubtedly not for the first time, that he\'92d best keep comedy as a side career. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stanley being best tailor all Minsk. I now telling you needing cutting off two inches.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93How long?\'94 asked Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93I telling you two inches!\'94\u8232 \'93No, no. How long will it take to do the alterations?\'94\u8232 \'93What!? What being that?\'94\u8232 \'93Al-te-ra-tions,\'94 Allan fell into the trap of believing that by the speaker 
\fs24 \

\fs32 speaking slowly, a listener who does not speak English well could understand the meaning of unfamiliar words. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93How long to Stanley doing cutting?\'94 Oakley asked, understanding that Stanley\'92s English skills were limited. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, doing cutting. Sure. Stanley taking ten minute. That being all. Stanley being best tailor all Minsk. Ten minute.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good,\'94 said Allan.\uc0\u8232 Stanley looked at his wristwatch.\u8232 \'93Stanley being finishing two o\'92clock.\'94\u8232 \'93Good. Great,\'94 exclaimed Oakley.\u8232 \'93Yeah. No joke. Stanley being finishing cutting being two o\'92clock. Tomorrow.\'94

\fs32 One thing about Salvation Army stores \'96 they have large storefront windows. As with other clothing stores, those windows are meant to attract shoppers. If anyone enters a Salvation Army store, however, they do so not as casual shoppers but with this destination in mind. No one window shopping for clothing actu- ally decides to enter a Salvation Army store. Vivian and Joan were the exception. After leaving the florist, they found the Salvation Army store around the corner. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Hundreds of dresses hung on racks from the front of the store to the rear. A saleswoman in her 60\'92s held out a somewhat stained purple dress in front of Vivian as Joan watched. She gestured with her free hand and blabbered. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This is very flattering. Tony Curtis wore it in \'91Some Like It Hot.\'92 Well, that\'92s what Mrs. Pozinsky said. You know her son changed his name to Goldstein so no one would know he was Jewish. She\'92s always bringing us things. But you never really know if she\'92s just making stuff up. I remember a couple years ago she brought in an entire . . . \'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Lovely,\'94 Vivian said, trying to silence the saleswoman. *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Pastor Elmer and Alice stood on the pulpit with Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and Joan. Pastor Elmer was now in official wedding chapel uniform, wearing a white and black clerical robe. Eleanor, in her 70s, sat at the organ, facing sheet music. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The trip to the tailor being partially successful, Oakley wore the white shirt, tuxedo, and bow tie. His pants legs were held up by safety pins. Stanley was very upset. Vivian wore a white dress and the ring from the key chain on her ring finger. They had mutually decided against hollowing out the pink gum- ball. Joan held a bouquet of flowers. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93. . . and wife. You may . . .,\'94 concluded Pastor Elmer. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They had seen, no doubt, numerous spur-of-the-moment marriages, but Pastor Elmer, Alice, and the organist, Eleanor, had probably never seen the premature show of affection they were witnessing. Vivian and Oakley had been kissing in an extended embrace before being named man and wife in the name of whatever power Pastor Elmer invoked. It was perhaps under- standable. The casino adventures, the near murder, and the rapid fire wedding preparation had electrified these nice young people. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Certainly, the pastor, Alice, and Eleanor had never seen the best man and maid of honor partake in the pulpit passion. Allan and Joan had joined Oakley and Vivian in their own extended embrace, as much out of passion as out of relief that the charade was over. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As soon as Pastor Elmer had finished pronouncing the marriage of Mr. Thorp and Mrs. Thorp, Eleanor had begun to sing \'93The Anniversary Song,\'94 accompanied by herself at the organ. She, too, had probably not witnessed such shenanigans and alternated looking back and forth at her music and the two couples. She flubbed some of the notes. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93. . . kiss the bride,\'94 Pastor Elmer finished directing Oakley, in one of the great anti-climactic statements in modern nuptial history. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Pastor Elmer and Alice watched the two couples celebrate, right there, they must have thought, by their previously pure, white trellised pulpit. Alice breathed deeply. \'93If not for the grace of G-d,\'94 she must have thought, either longingly or thankfully. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Eleanor sang. Her thin voice was somewhat out of tune. Oakley and Vivian might have noticed if they had been paying attention.

\fs32 \cf3 As she continued to alternate between looking at the couples and her sheet music, the distracted Eleanor made more and more errors in musicianship. One might have feared for her livelihood if indeed Pastor Elmer and Alice hadn\'92t been similarly occupied.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Okay. That\'92s good,\'94 said a breathless Pastor Elmer to the two couples, try- ing to regain control over the imminent desecration of his church. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay. Okay.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Let\'92s say I have a box with ten red balls and ten white balls. If I pull out a red ball I win and if I pull out a white ball I lose. What\'92s the probability that I\'92ll pull out a red ball and win? Fifty percent. Easy. And if I put that red ball back in, the probability I\'92ll pull a red ball the next time is still 50%. But now let\'92s say I don\'92t put the red ball back in and so now the box has only nine red balls. Now the probability I\'92ll pick out a red ball and win is only nine out of nineteen or about (pause) 47%. It\'92s gone down because I didn\'92t replace the red ball.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was in a good mood. Why not? He was now married to a woman he loved, and he had been a, relatively speaking, big winner at the tables. He was in lecture mode with an excruciatingly captive audience. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s red Ford Thunderbird was within the speed limit as they drove along Highway 50 on the first leg of their trip back to L.A. A box of unopened Uncle Ben\'92s Converted Rice sat on the dashboard playing tag with his min- iature dartboard and the red fuzzy dice souvenir. Oakley had suggested they might need the rice for dinner. Vivian sat next to him. They were both in their wedding outfits, Oakley in his tuxedo and Vivian in her white dress. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian held a bag of oranges, a box of Oreo cookies, and some napkins in her lap. Allan and Joan sat in the back seat. Joan hugged the bouquet of flow- ers. Vivian was peeling an orange. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yep,\'94 Vivian said. \'93Very obvious.\'94 Hopefully Vivian was not only inter- ested but attentive. If not, she faced an unhappy life with Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 continued Oakley. \'93Now take a deck of cards.\'94 \'93Take my wife, please,\'94 said Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Not yet,\'94 said Oakley. \'93I still haven\'92t made up my mind.\'94 Vivian slapped him on the shoulder. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m driving, dear,\'94 said Oakley, now in having-been-married-for-30-years mode. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You can ask what\'92s the probability I\'92ll win a hand with a full deck of cards, like with the full box of red and white balls. Then, let\'92s do this experiment. Remove a deuce. Now what\'92s the probability I\'92ll win a hand? Remove two deuces. What\'92s the probability I\'92ll win a hand? And so on. We\'92ve got to con- sider every possibility of cards being removed from the deck and see how it affects the probabilities of winning.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Notice the smoke coming out of Edward\'92s ears?\'94 admired Vivian. \'93Here have a slice of orange.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She handed Oakley a slice of a peeled orange and a napkin. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thanks. I need the energy.\'94 Oakley hoped that Vivian remembered their words on the day following the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You guys want some?\'94 Vivian said to Allan and Joan in the back seat. \'93Sure,\'94 said Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93See, it\'92s not like flipping a coin or spinning the roulette wheel where the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 probabilities always stay the same. The result of each flip or spin is indepen- dent of all those that preceded it and all those that will follow. Those are pure games of chance.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here,\'94 Vivian said as she handed two orange slices and two napkins to Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thanks,\'94 replied Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But every time you remove a card, the probabilities change. The cards have a memory of their buddies who have left. The presence or absence of some types of cards have to favor the house, and the presence or absence of other types of cards have to favor the player,\'94 Oakley reasoned out loud, in furious thought. \'93Blackjack, for crying out loud, is not a game of chance!\'94 Oakley ate his orange slice relishing both its freshness and his ability to devise a personi- fication metaphor while both eating and driving. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hmmm. Great,\'94 Oakley judged. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Gone to that big discard pile in the sky, so to speak,\'94 said Allan, appreciat- ing Oakley\'92s cleverness. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Poor little cards,\'94 said Joan while caressing the bouquet and eating her orange slice. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, so to speak,\'94 said Oakley, perhaps bothered that the Personification Monster he had created had evolved an existence of its own, distracting his students from the lecture. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But that\'92s the key to developing a more advanced system than that of Baldwin and his pals,\'94 Oakley persisted. \'93Their system is a very basic strategy. They don\'92t take into account the changing nature of the deck.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93It\'92s as if they\'92re playing with an infinite number of decks of cards,\'94 opined Allan. He, of course, was fully aware of the significance of Oakley\'92s words. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s exactly how you have to look at it. Baldwin treated the game as if it was sampling with replacement. But it\'92s not. It\'92s sampling without replace- ment, so the probabilities change, and we have to figure out which cards being removed from the deck favor the player and which being removed favor the house. Obviously, removing tens and Aces favor the house.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You can\'92t do all those calculations by hand,\'94 said Allan. \'93Well, maybe some guys have. At least Baldwin and his guys used a calculator.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m sure some guys have done it by hand. Or tried to do it by hand. You\'92d have to deal yourself thousands of hands and keep track of what\'92s going on. Maybe somebody did it analytically. Hopefully, I\'92ll find some simplifications that will allow a shortcut. I think it\'92s going to be fun.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian tweaked Oakley\'92s ear.\uc0\u8232 \'93I think being married to a mathematician is going to be fun.\'94\u8232 \'93I wanna be married to a mathematician,\'94 said Joan, in a playful mood. \'93I 
\fs24 \

\fs32 wanna be married to a mathematician. I wanna be married to a mathematician.\'94 \'93See what you\'92ve started?\'94 Allan observed to Oakley.

\fs32 \cf3 Nine out of ten Americans don\'92t realize that the city of broad shoulders not only has a beach but also an extensive beach stretching twenty miles north and south along Lake Michigan. The master plan of city planner Daniel Burnham included yacht harbors, extensive parks, and a road parallel to the beach stretching from the far north side of Chicago to the far south side. Office and apartment buildings would not be allowed within nearly a mile from the Lake Front, as it was known. The drive along Lake Shore Drive appealed to bicy- clists, walkers, runners, as well as those in automobiles. Pedestrian overpasses allowed beachgoers to avoid the traffic. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If you drove directly east into Chicago along Congress Parkway you would proceed under the massive post office building, into the Loop, past Michigan Avenue, and into Grant Park. Michigan Avenue compares to other grand boulevards of the worlds, with The Bund in Shanghai an appropriate refer- ence. Both Michigan Avenue and The Bund are associated with waterfronts. If you stood in Grant Park and looked westward, you\'92d see a stretch of buildings from north to south. The Conrad Hilton, the Chicago Symphony building, and others were situated there, straight, in a row, forming a backdrop for the park rather than an intrusion. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At the end of Congress Parkway, where the road terminates with right- or left-hand turns onto Lake Shore Drive, was the answer of Chicago to the great fountains of Rome. Buckingham Fountain, designed by Burnham\'92s collabora- tor Edward Bennett, is a nearly three-hundred-foot-diameter structure, with water-spouting stone classical figures directing their streams into the moat surrounding them. On summer nights, light shows of multiple colors ema- nating from underwater lamps accompanied the water jets, in well-designed

\fs24 \

\fs32 The shoreline east of Buckingham Fountain was an embarkation point for tour boats. On summer nights such as this, with a gentle breeze creating gentle waves, deck lights from sailboats and yachts on Lake Michigan would flicker as the boats swayed in the water. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian and Nancy, holding hands, were among a crowd of about eighty people watching the light show. It ended with a display of towering streams of water, and the crowd applauded, although no light designer, hydraulic engi- neer, or choreographer was there to receive the accolades. Julian lifted their hands to his lips and kissed Nancy\'92s hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was only 10:30 or so, too early to abandon a nice evening, so Julian and Nancy went for a walk north through the rose gardens, part of the Versailles- like gardens of Grant Park also designed by Bennett, and then veered east to continue walking along the shore of Lake Michigan, all the while holding hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, I know,\'94 observed Julian. \'93But it was over so fast. It was over as soon as it started. It reminds me of the brevity of life.\'94 Julian was finding melan- choly in the evening. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, Julian,\'94 Nancy said.\uc0\u8232 \'93And the finality of death.\'94\u8232 \'93It\'92s Saturday night, Julian.\'94\u8232 Julian persisted in wallowing in his mood. By this time in their relation- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ship, he was comfortable sharing dark thoughts as well as mathematical frivol- ity, if there is such a thing, with Nancy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I remember reading 
\f2\i Of Human Bondage 
\f1\i0 by Somerset Maugham in high school. It tried to answer the question of \'91what is the meaning of life?\'92 Since then, really, I\'92ve thought about it a lot. I think I came up with a pretty good answer. I know it sounds contradictory, but I think the meaning of life is to gain immortality.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, that\'92s good,\'94 Nancy half sighed and half spoke.\uc0\u8232 \'93We live so that we can find a way to never die.\'94\u8232 \'93Oh, gosh. That\'92s beautiful, Julian.\'94\u8232 \'93Think about it. People get married so \'96 well, one reason at least \'96 so they

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Some people give money to name a library after themselves,\'94 Julian con- tinued, expounding on his thesis. \'93Some build up a stamp collection. Some write books. Some get prominent enough and lucky enough to have a screen- play written about them. These all achieve immortality, too. The vast majority don\'92t have the money to fund a library or an interest in stamps or the brains to write a book, so they have kids.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What did Somerset Maugham say?\'94 Nancy had gotten entrapped by Julian\'92s mind into what was apparently going to be the theme for the rest of their Saturday night date. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93He said the meaning of life is the pattern of life.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hmmm,\'94 Nancy hummed, not satisfied with the discovery of Mr. Maugham. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Exactly. A pretty long book and not a very good answer. It\'92s a tautology really. They mean about the same thing.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. I love your mind, Julian.\'94 Julian had been able to use a term from logic to describe the conclusion of a great American novel. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nancy pointed to a concrete ledge by the lakeshore. These concrete faux- boulders had to suffice for those wanting to view the lake from the Fullerton Avenue beach. It would have been too expensive for city fathers to have hauled in 10-ton boulders from glacial moraines. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here,\'94 she said, pointing to a spot. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They sat and kissed briefly. They stared out at the waves. Lake Michigan lacks the thundering surf of the east, west, and Gulf coasts, but on a night with a gentle breeze the surf would still break on the beach, spilling white foamy water over its crest. A bobbing sailboat passed by.

\fs32 \cf3 Nancy placed her head on Julian\'92s shoulder. He raised her hand to his mouth and kissed it. The flicker of lights from bobbing sailboats accompanied the sound of crickets courting in the grass. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A loud chorus of crickets serenaded the night outside Oakley\'92s rented coach house in Santa Monica. Insect mating seemed to be the rage this night from coast to coast, as the lyric from \'93Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most\'94 would say. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Street lights visible through the kitchen window illuminated trees against the night sky. At the kitchen table, Oakley sat with a calculator, a deck of cards, and a vase holding the wedding bouquet. The kitchen wall clock her- alded 1:30 a.m., and, I guess, all\'92s well. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The seven-hour drive along Highway 50 to Sacramento and then south on the interminable Highway 99 had taken nearly nine hours, Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and Joan taking frequent road stops to keep fresh. They had eaten din- ner in Bakersfield, and it might have been chipped beef for the lack of culi- nary sophistication. Although Mr. and Mrs. Thorp had dropped off Allan and Joan and arrived at his coach house several hours ago, Mr. Thorp still hadn\'92t gotten completely out of his tuxedo. He remained dressed in his tuxedo shirt and black tuxedo pants. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was writing on a sheet of paper, which served as a tally sheet. Vivian stood next to him, dressed in a nightgown and robe. With her arm around his shoulder, she leaned over the table and stared in disbelief at the tally sheet. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92ve done thirty decks?\'94 she said.\uc0\u8232 \'93Just twenty more,\'94 replied Oakley.\u8232 \'93Being married to a mathematician sure is fun. Especially the honeymoon 
\fs24 \

\fs32 night,\'94 she lamented.\uc0\u8232 Oakley got the message, but still shuffled up the deck of cards.\u8232 \'93Well, maybe just ten more.\'94 He was in a creative trance that she would 
\fs24 \

\fs32 recognize many more times in their lives together.\uc0\u8232 \'93How\'92s it look?\'94 she asked. It was apparent that the honeymoon night 
\fs24 \

\fs32 activities would be temporarily suspended in the interests of science. She could accept his eccentricities. She had no choice, but didn\'92t mind. It was part of the package of being with the man she truly loved. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The result with the Aces removed was expected. I lost about two-and-a- half percent of my action. I mean, there\'92s no chance for a blackjack and there\'92s no splitting Aces.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Vivian twirled her finger in his ear.\uc0\u8232 \'93Just as expected.\'94\u8232 \'93And we know removing tens from the deck will hurt the player, too. So I 
\fs24 \

\fs32 thought, what card is furthest removed from the one, that is, the Ace, and the ten? It\'92s the five. So I removed all the fives.\'94 Oakley had at that moment dis- covered one of the basic theoretical concepts of what would become known as card counting. It would lead to the development of his first system, the \'93five-count strategy.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good. And?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here are the numbers,\'94 he pointed to the tally sheet. Vivian stared at it, her eyes having troubling focusing, the fatigue of the day now interfering with her ability to appreciate Oakley\'92s brilliance. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ve dealt now just over fifteen decks with the fives removed and in all but four I won. And I\'92ve won significantly. Blackjack, darling, is not a game of chance.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s exciting,\'94 she said. \'93Very exciting.\'94 If she had to seduce him both verbally and physically, she would do so, as she began nibbling on his ear. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re following Baldwin\'92s rules?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Just like at Barney\'92s.\'94 He pointed to the tally sheet.\u8232 \'93Here.\'94\u8232 Vivian blew softly in his ear and leaned over to look at the tally sheet. \'93I\'92m ranging between winning two and six percent of my action,\'94 he 
\fs24 \

\fs32 declared with a mixture of triumph and amazement. \'93Average about three- and-a-half percent. Removing the fives gives an advantage to the player.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s fantastic,\'94 she agreed. \'93Exciting,\'94 she added, purposely using that term again. \'93You\'92ve got a lot of action here.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She put her arms around his neck. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, maybe only five more decks,\'94 said Oakley, not immune to her seduction. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Isn\'92t it obvious what\'92s happening?\'94 she hinted. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley turned around. \'93Yeah, I guess it is.\'94 He had surrendered to her siren\'92s call, the dual meaning of \'93action\'94 now being weighted more toward her figure rather than his figures. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What\'92s happening, Eddie my love?\'94\uc0\u8232 Oakley tenderly touched her cheek.\u8232 \'93I think being married to a mathematician is going to be fun.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93That\'92s good,\'94 said Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The blackboard inside room 122 was full of mathematical equations and geometric figures scribbled in chalk. Professor Taylor, Professor Robert Sorgenfrey, and Professor John Selfridge sat in chairs in the front row. Oakley stood at the blackboard with a piece of chalk in his right hand. Taylor was the head of Oakley\'92s dissertation committee. The other two mathematics professors completed the committee. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bob, do you have any more questions for Mr. Thorp?\'94 asked Professor Taylor to his colleague. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m happy,\'94 replied Professor Sorgenfrey. Oakley was happy to have Professor Sorgenfrey on his committee, he being the individual who had referred Oakley to the Baldwin article. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93John?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Nope,\'94 answered Professor Selfridge.\u8232 \'93I\'92ve got one more question,\'94 Professor Taylor said to Oakley.\u8232 Oakley thought he had done pretty well. A dissertation defense is fre- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 quently a formality. The faculty advisor, in Oakley\'92s case Angus Taylor, had guided Oakley\'92s work throughout and was aware that it was suitable for awarding the Ph.D. Sometimes, rarely, a particularly difficult additional com- mittee member would find a flaw in the proof, a lemma that required further substantiation, an assumption that was unwarranted, or some other problem. Such defects were usually not fatal. At worst, the candidate would be directed to provide additional steps in the proof. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Mathematicians are a rare breed. They are like classical pianists or chess masters. Either you have this ability to intuitively \'93see\'94 the logic or you don\'92t. Unlike other fields, such as astronomy, physics, biology, chemistry, botany, anthropology, sociology, political science, art history, architecture, and litera- ture, where a large body of previous knowledge must be studied, in mathe- matics you need only complete a proof. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In the sciences, in particular, our minds are too feeble to deduce the count- less manifestations of the laws of nature. It was the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington, after all, who supposedly had said that if Earth were enshrouded in clouds we would never have known that stars exist. You must first observe the manifestations of nature, and then try to understand them in terms of those laws of nature. Acquiring Ph.D. level proficiency in most subjects requires, in short, the assimilation of a large body of knowledge. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In mathematics, in contrast, someone with the requisite intuitive logic skills can get a Ph.D. in mathematics in two or three years. State a proposi- tion, see the solution, and do the proof. Anyone who takes ten years to get a Ph.D. in mathematics doesn\'92t have the ability.

\fs32 \cf3 You have child prodigies in piano and chess for similar reasons. You either have the music in your head or have an advanced mode of both right and left brain processing that allows you to see dozens of moves ahead, respectively, in which cases you attain a professional level quickly, or you don\'92t. One never hears of a child prodigy in astronomy or physics. One simply cannot master the body of knowledge that quickly. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley thought he had done well enough to pass. Now Professor Taylor had another question. It could be a zinger. Maybe he had realized in the last two hours that Oakley had slipped up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yes?\'94 said Oakley, trying to hide his apprehension. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Did you hear the one about the engineering, physics, and math graduates?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed out loud. 
\f2\i Ah, a joke. Angus is going to tell a joke, 
\f1\i0 he thought. Oakley carried himself with dignity, just like Vivian. Most people, at first meeting him, would think he was almost intimidating. When, however, he laughed, he had a broad grin that would light up an entire room. It was inevitable that that gleam would lead to the end of this dissertation defense being full of levity. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Shoot,\'94 said Professor Sorgenfrey to Angus.\u8232 \'93The college graduate with an engineering degree asks, \'91How does it work?\'92 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The college graduate with a physics degree asks, \'91Why does it work?\'92 The college graduate with a mathematics degree asks, \'91In which finite spaces does it work?\'92 The college graduate with a philosophy degree asks, \'91What do you mean by \'91work\'92?\'92 The college graduate with an art history degree asks, \'91You want fries with that?\'92 \'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all laughed uproariously.\uc0\u8232 The friends waiting outside room 122 heard the laughter.\u8232 \'93Oh, God!\'94 said Vivian.\u8232 Allan buried his head in his hands.\u8232 \'93He\'92s dead,\'94 agreed Joan. \'93He\'92s dead.\'94\u8232 \'93If they\'92re going to give you a Ph. D, they want to make sure you\'92re good 
\fs24 \

\fs32 enough so they can keep their reputations,\'94 lectured Allan disrespectfully. \'93Unbelievable!\'94 said Vivian, new to this nuance of academia.\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s like being invited into a fraternity,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 \'93Oh, Edward,\'94 said Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Without the partying after the initiation,\'94 said Allan, continuing the simile. \'93Well, we\'92ll see about that party.\'94 Allan must have been reliving his unpleasant dissertation defense, and apparently imagining some kind of unrealistic retribution.

\fs32 \cf3 Inside the lecture hall, Oakley raised his hand, still in student mode. Some Ph.D.\'92s, having spent a decade or more as students, have recurrent dreams their entire lives about raising their hand to get the floor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ve got one,\'94 he said.\uc0\u8232 \'93Go ahead,\'94 said Professor Taylor.\u8232 \'93Okay. The surgeon and his team are operating on this guy. The surgeon says 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to the resident, \'91Dr. Jones, how\'92s the blood pressure?\'92 \'91Fine,\'92 he says. He says to the anesthesiologist, \'91Dr. Smith, how\'92s the oxygen level?\'92 \'91Fine,\'92 he says. He says to the intern, \'91Dr. Reed, how\'92s the spleen?\'92 Dr. Reed says, \'91Spleen!? Spleen!? I didn\'92t know we had to know spleen!\'92 \'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s laugh was the loudest of the loud laughter of the four of them. He was now fully relieved that he had passed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thorp, I hope you never have students like that,\'94 said Professor Selfridge. \'93By the way, do you know how can you tell the most recently hired assistant professor?\'94 The others exchanged glances, this joke not being familiar. \'93He\'92s the one without the knife in his back.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The raucous laughter continued. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian didn\'92t have to place her ear next to the door to hear the laughter. She pushed Allan aside. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s it,\'94 she exclaimed. \'93I don\'92t care who they are or how badly he did. They\'92re not going to mock him.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She strode to the door and grabbed for the knob. Before she could open it, the door swung open. Oakley walked out, with Professor Taylor\'92s arm wrapped around his shoulder. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward!\'94 Vivian cried out. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s 
\f2\i dim sum 
\f1\i0 lunch for all,\'94 said a beaming Angus. \'93And it\'92s on the department.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s right, Edward, if you had failed we would have all starved today,\'94 said Angus, making a presentation at Larry Toy\'92s Restaurant in Westwood. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Ever since they sat down for lunch, the laughter had been non-stop. Chinese cuisine to these people didn\'92t match the excitement of Korean or Vietnamese food, but Little Korea and Little Vietnam were miles east, near downtown Los Angeles, whereas Larry Toy\'92s was one of the many Chinese restaurants catering to the student population in Westwood. It was also a tradition to have 
\f2\i dim sum 
\f1\i0 at the successful conclusion of a dissertation defense and that assemblage of small delights was only Cantonese.

\fs32 \cf3 If a Chinese student were being celebrated, he would have the chef prepare specialties known only to Chinese. That would be especially intriguing to the others, not knowing what kind of Oriental curiosities were being prepared. Still, the assorted dumplings, buns, rolls, rolled noodles, and steamed, boiled, and deep fried fish and meats fully massaged the receptive minds of the academics. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Tea cups, a pot of tea, and fortune cookies lay on a large circular table, the best way in which to serve the many 
\f2\i dim sum 
\f1\i0 dishes. Angus Taylor stood, delivering appropriate post-lunch niceties. Sorgenfrey, Selfridge, Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and Joan sat. Allan had brought a camera with an electronic flash attachment. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So, that\'92s why you guys churn out the Ph. D\'92s,\'94 said Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93The secret is out, Angus,\'94 lamented Sorgenfrey.\u8232 They all laughed.\u8232 \'93Okay,\'94 said Angus. \'93Now, to get serious. I have some good news and I 
\fs24 \

\fs32 have some bad news.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93You mean, I have only one hour of happiness?\'94 said Vivian, relishing her 
\fs24 \

\fs32 introduction into mathematics collegiality.\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, okay,\'94 responded Angus. \'93Because Edward passed, let me first give 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the good news. Yesterday afternoon a telegram from MIT was delivered to Edward at his department address.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He pulled out a telegram from his pocket.\uc0\u8232 \'93I held it back until today.\'94\u8232 \'93That was a wise decision,\'94 said Oakley. Knowing his application for a 
\fs24 \

\fs32 prestigious position had been received and acted upon would have no doubt distracted Oakley from his preparations for his defense, particularly if it had been rejected. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Edward, I mean, Dr. Thorp, has been awarded a C. L. E. Moore Instructorship in the math department at MIT,\'94 said Angus. \'93It is one of the most prized positions in our field.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Everyone applauded and cheered. Allan nearly dislocated Oakley\'92s wrist shaking his hand. Vivian gave him a hug. The professors each shook his hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, great,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Thank you, thank you. Great.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93You mean, my husband has a job?\'94 asked Vivian.\u8232 They all laughed. She was fully accepted as a prospective faculty wife. It was 
\fs24 \

\fs32 time for more levity.\uc0\u8232 \'93You know the old joke about the pizza?\'94 asked Selfridge.\u8232 \'93Go ahead,\'94 said Oakley.\u8232 \'93What\'92s the difference between a sixteen-inch pizza and a mathematician?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Selfridge asked. Apparently the young people hadn\'92t heard the joke.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Angus and Sorgenfrey had undoubtedly heard it, but they weren't going to spoil Selfridge\'92s fun. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The pizza can feed a family of four,\'94 delivered Selfridge. He almost stumbled on the punch line laughing at his own joke. He was definitely not Comedy Store material, that popular hangout for UCLA students down Westwood Blvd. from Larry Toy\'92s. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Everyone laughed at the joke, the skill of the delivery notwithstanding. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Seriously, Vivian,\'94 offered Sorgenfrey, \'93in academia we say a person has an appointment or position, not a job.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s because he doesn\'92t get paid unless he also buses dishes at some campus fraternity, right Dr. Sorgenfrey?\'94 noted Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s not quite true, Allan,\'94 Angus corrected him. \'93He\'92ll be . . .\'94 Angus took a moment to read the telegram. He clearly had a better sense of comedy than his colleague. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93 . . . busing dishes at the MIT faculty club,\'94 he concluded. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 This was perhaps the best zinger of the afternoon, and they all laughed heartily. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Much more prestigious,\'94 said Oakley in mock relief, to additional laughter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Angus looked again at the telegram. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Only lunches,\'94 he read. This guy was on a roll, as the continued laughter testified. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good,\'94 noted Vivian. \'93Then you\'92ll be home for dinners.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You said there was bad news,\'94 said Oakley, reminding Angus of his introductory comment. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ah, yes,\'94 recalled Angus. \'93I\'92m sorry to say, I\'92m very sorry, Edward, to have to say, that . . . \'94 he hesitated. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley and Vivian were understandably quiet. They had to be wondering if this was another set-up to a joke or did Oakley\'92s advisor in fact have some crushing information affecting Oakley\'92s future. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Angus continued, \'93. . . as a result of obtaining this position Dr. Thorp will not be staying on at UCLA beyond his one-year teaching appointment as a research post-doc.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s bad news?\'94 mocked Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 This time Oakley led the raucous laughter. He almost felt like strangling the good professor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I would like to propose a toast,\'94 said Selfridge, standing. It would have been appropriate for Angus to propose the toast, but he was still laughing at the success of his delivery. He gestured for the rest to stand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hear, hear!\'94 shouted Angus, rising.

\fs32 \cf3 Sorgenfrey, Vivian, Allan, and Joan stood up with their tea cups raised. Only a group of academics would make a toast using tea cups, Oakley must have thought. He stood up to join his friends, not really understanding the protocol. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Angus?\'94 said Selfridge knowing that Professor Taylor would be, as I said, the appropriate one to make the toast. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thank you, John,\'94 said Angus. \'93Dr. Thorp, you have been a brilliant student,\'94 he said. \'93We know you will have a brilliant career. To the best of health, happiness, and prosperity to you and your lovely wife in your new position and beyond. Cheers!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Together they all joined in a chorus of \'93Cheers!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian hugged Oakley, the group offered another round of handshakes, and Vivian hugged Oakley. Seeing this, Allan quickly grabbed his camera, stood back, and took a photograph of the two of them.

\fs32 \cf3 Academic annual meetings differ from their counterparts in the other professions and the business world. Medical association meetings, for exam- ple, serve to announce advancements in equipment and therapies, provide a job fair, and create a forum for vendors to promote new techniques, software, and diagnostic equipment. Corporate meetings serve to instruct sales staff in new products and selling techniques, introduce new promotional material, and stimulate morale, money being the bottom line. Entertainment of some sort is provided, I believe, to stimulate the inevitably waning enthusiasm of the sales staff. Non-corporate business meetings, from my admittedly meager experience, are basically vacations. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Academic meetings have other functions, all associated with colleges and universities and research institutions. First, they provide undergraduates an opportunity to make their first presentations. Second, they provide junior faculty an opportunity to expand their resume, hopefully leading to tenure at their present or some future school. Vendors will be present, including book publishers and developers of whatever educational and research aids are appropriate to the given discipline. Job fairs are a major attraction, both for the recent graduates and hiring institutions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The overall goal is to disseminate the latest research. Academia is specialized, with faculty and researchers in one area having limited knowledge of the latest results in other areas. A typical session will have, depending on the topic,

\fs32 \cf3 a couple dozen to maybe fifty attendees of those doing research in that area. Although it\'92s challenging enough to keep up in your own specialty, these meetings provide academics the opportunity to learn about advances in other specialties. From a social standpoint, meetings provide a common venue for former colleagues, either as students or faculty who have gone to other institu- tions, to reconnect. These meetings, as a result of these reconnections as well as the finely tuned senses of humor, sparkle with joviality. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The 1961 forty-fourth annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Washington, D.C., was typical of such gatherings, with one excep- tion. A young professor from MIT was presenting a paper on a strategy for the casino game of blackjack. Anticipation of this event had led to articles on January 25, the day before his Thursday, January 26, presentation, in the 
\f2\i Washington Post
\f1\i0 , 
\f2\i Boston Globe
\f1\i0 , and other papers, the content of which was quickly picked up via news services by thousands of other newspapers across the country. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After his encounter with Baldwin\'92s system during his trip to South Lake Tahoe with Vivian, Allan, and Joan, Oakley had spent more than one hun- dred hours playing mock hands of blackjack, studying the effect of removing one or more of the Aces, then removing one or more of the twos, through all ten types of cards, the tens, Jacks, Queens, and Kings being all considered ten-value cards. It had taken Baldwin, Cantey, Maisel, and McDermott thousands of hours over one and one-half years, working evenings and week- ends, to develop just their basic strategy. At Oakley\'92s request, Baldwin had sent him the notebooks of his group\'92s calculations, enough to fill a card- board carton. As he studied them over weeks in the spring of 1959, Oakley became further convinced that the Four Horsemen hadn\'92t discovered the hidden secrets of the game. Their strategy, while sound, only considered the dealer\'92s up-card and the player\'92s two cards. He tried, working in a trancelike state, but he eventually admitted to himself that he had taken on a prob- lem too complex to solve in his lifetime, even in a simplified form. He gave up, a crushing decision for someone as competitive as Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After beginning his duties in the summer of 1959 in the C. L. E. Moore position at MIT, however, he was given permission to use their IBM high- speed 704 electronic digital computer at the MIT Computation Center. Now he had a real electronic computing machine with which to perform his calcu- lations. He was sure he\'92d have to make some approximations, but thought this venture would provide great scholarly rewards and great fun. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 First, he had to learn how to communicate with the 704 electronic digital computer. As many bright professors and graduate students in the sciences would do beginning in the 1960s, Oakley taught himself the FORTRAN 
\fs24 \

\fs32 programming language, short for \'93formula translation.\'94 The program was designed for mathematical analyses. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Using this great tool, much more sophisticated than the Friden electrical- mechanical calculating machines that Baldwin and his group had available, he joyfully and systematically programmed the effect of removing cards of various values from the deck. It became clear, without laboriously dealing mock hands for hundreds of hours, that removal of the low value cards, the twos through the sixes, provided an advantage to the player, and that removal of the ten- value cards and Aces provided an advantage to the house. Such a possibility had hit him after trying Baldwin\'92s system on that trip to South Lake Tahoe with Vivian, Allan, and Joan, reinforced, briefly, on his honeymoon night, and tantalizingly indicated in the more than the mentioned one hundred hours of dealing himself mock blackjack hands over eighteen months while he remained in L.A. after the Tahoe trip. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had proceeded systematically. First, he wanted to use the 704 electronic computer to discover the improvements he could make over Baldwin and his group\'92s system. It was obvious that his use of a much more powerful comput- ing tool than their hand calculators would provide some if not many. He began with a full 52-card deck. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The necessary initial data were the probabilities of the dealer getting a given total for a given up-card, knowing that the dealer has to stand with a total of 17. If, for example, the dealer had an up-card of 5, Oakley had to determine the probability that after drawing the dealer would end up with a total of 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or bust. To do this by hand to obtain results with reasonable preci- sion would require dealing thousands of hands. That\'92s the chore that Baldwin\'92s group faced. With FORTRAN and the 704, it required just twenty or so lines of code, and he could have the computer deal as many hands as he wanted until no significantly different result would be obtained by dealing more. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The results were startling. If the dealer\'92s up-card were a 4, 5, or 6, Oakley found that the dealer had a 40%, 43%, and 40% chance of busting, respec- tively, nearly half the time! If the up-card were a ten-value card or Ace, on the other hand, the chances were only 21% or 12% of busting, but the dealer in those cases had a 37% and 52% chance of obtaining a total of 21. With only this knowledge, the player would be encouraged to split and double down more frequently against a dealer showing an up-card of 4, 5, or 6. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 These results provided the foundation for all the subsequent calculations. To determine, for example, the player\'92s advantage for standing on a given total, one would simply add up the probabilities that the dealer would fall short of that total or bust and subtract the sum of the probabilities that the dealer would exceed that total.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Thus, to determine the player\'92s advantage for standing with an 18 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5, Oakley would add the probabilities that the dealer would obtain a 17 or bust, which he found to be 0.120 and 0.429, respectively, for a sum of 0.549, and subtract the probabilities that he would obtain a 19, 20, or 21, which he found to be 0.117, 0.105, and 0.106, respectively, for a sum of 0.328. The total would be 0.549 \uc0\u8722  0.328 = 0.221, indicating that the player had a 2.21% advantage by standing with an 18 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In general the player also has the option of taking a card to improve his or her hand. Oakley therefore also programmed the 704 to determine the advan- tage the player would obtain by drawing cards. This would be a little more complicated. In our example, the player could draw an Ace, 2, or 3 to improve the hand, whereas drawing a card with a higher value would cause him or her to bust. The same summing of respective probabilities would yield the advantage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If, for example, the player were given a 3, giving him a total of 21, then the probability that he would win against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5 was the sum of the probabilities that the dealer would get a 17, 18, 19, 20, or bust times the probability that the player would actually get that 3, minus the probability that the player would bust, getting a card with a value greater than 3. The same calculation would have to be performed if he had drawn an Ace or a 2, and Oakley would then add the results of the three calculations to determine the advantage of drawing the card. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The difference between the advantages of drawing or standing would deter- mine the player\'92s strategy when faced, in this example, with an 18 against the dealer\'92s up-card of five. If the player didn\'92t bust, he had a further option of drawing another card or standing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He similarly programmed the 704 to determine the advantages to the player of doubling down with given totals against the ten possible up-cards of the dealer, and the advantages to the player of splitting pairs, again against the ten possible up-cards of the dealer. Taken together, for every dealer up-card, the player with any two cards could now compare the advantages for splitting, doubling down, and drawing or standing to see which was the most advanta- geous strategy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 No wonder it took Baldwin and his gang thousands of hours to do this by hand calculator. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now Oakley faced a creative conundrum. The drawing and standing table was a matrix of ten possible dealer up-cards and nine possible player\'92s hands, 12 through 20, a player having less than 12 always taking another card. That was a total of ninety entries. The hard and soft doubling down tables and the splitting table added dozens more. Because he couldn\'92t expect anyone to 
\fs24 \

\fs32 memorize 150 to 200 decisions, he had to determine a means to organize the results into something more congenial to actual casino play. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He followed Baldwin\'92s lead. First, most of the decisions are obvious. You don\'92t double down on a sixteen. You don\'92t split fives. You don\'92t take a hit on a twenty. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He further simplified the results for actual casino use by combining all deci- sions for a given dealer up-card. The logic was simple. If the results showed that a player should hold with a 17 against the dealer\'92s up card of ten, then the results showed the obvious, that he should hold with an 18, 19, 20, or 21. If the results showed that the player should double down with a ten against the dealer\'92s up-card of nine, then he should also double down against the dealer\'92s up-card of two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 With these simplifications, the result could be summarized in concise tables that the player could memorize with what Oakley considered an acceptable, if not minimum, effort. Oakley, with the quick mind of the 704 as his partner, was revolutionizing the game of blackjack. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Taken together, Oakley\'92s more precise results showed that the player in a typical casino had a 0.12% advantage over the house. If he followed the direc- tions that Oakley summarized in the concise tables, for every $1000 wagered the player would in the long run make $1.20. Oakley referred to the refined system as the \'93basic strategy.\'94 The results showed that Baldwin\'92s group, while groundbreaking pioneers, had erred in their hand calculations slightly, having concluded that it was the house that had the small advantage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They had published a result that the house would have a 0.62% advantage, which they later found, as communicated by Wilbert Cantey to Oakley, was incorrect as a result of an arithmetic error and that the house advantage was actually only 0.32%. Oakley redid his computer calculation using the strategy they had published, and in fact found that their system provided an advantage to the player of 0.09%, remarkably close, attesting to the magnitude of their efforts, to Oakley\'92s electronic computer-generated results. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Because the system as published by Baldwin and his colleagues, and cor- rected, gave the house that small 0.32% advantage, a nearly even-money game much better for the player than any other casino game, the implication was clear that a skillful and somewhat lucky player could win at blackjack. Oakley had now shown that in the long run the player did not need skill or luck, but would indeed win, although at a miniscule rate. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 All that work to the good, Oakley\'92s results were basically a validation of Baldwin\'92s results, and Oakley had yet to incorporate blackjack not being, as he had noted to his friends after the marriage ceremony, a game of chance, that the trials in a game of sampling without replacement are not independent. He had to calculate using the 704 the effect of removing various cards.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 He redid the analysis for removing one, two, three, and four of the fives. His results were astounding. The results showed that removing the fives provided up to a 3.6% advantage for the player. To any casual observer, using a favorite expression of scientists, this was a major, major advance. Wager $1000 and you expect to win in the long run $36. He referred to the strategy based on tracking the number of fives dealt from the deck as the \'93five-count strategy.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Astonished, invigorated, ebullient, he carried on relentlessly. He began to study the effect of removing ten-value cards from the 52-card deck. He would proceed just as he had with removing the fives, but now he would have to calculate the effect of removing 16 cards. As he had noted to Vivian in her nightgown, an abundance of ten-value cards and Aces compared to a neutral deck would increase the chances of blackjack. Because the dealer has to take a hit on 17, their presence increases his or her chances of busting. The player, who is not so constrained, can decline to take a hit holding cards which total, for example, 16, knowing that the deck is rich in ten-value cards. The pres- ence of those cards, Oakley thought, should also direct the player to double down and split more frequently. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On the other hand, the presence of low-value cards would help the house. The dealer has to take a hit below seventeen. He or she would have a better chance of drawing one or more low-value cards, getting a 20 or 21. Oakley reasoned that when the deck is rich in low-value cards compared to a neutral deck, the player should double down and split less frequently, and take a card rather than stand with poor hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was becoming increasingly clear to Oakley that having the deck relatively rich in low-value cards decreases the player\'92s advantage, but having the deck relatively rich in high-value cards would increase his or her advantage. He had, accordingly, begun programming the 704 for a more advanced system based on tracking the ten-value cards that had been dealt. That would be called the \'93ten-count strategy.\'94 He estimated that, assuming it takes 10 seconds to play a hand in the casino, the 704 calculations, which played more than 30 billion hands, would have taken 10,000 man-years of actual casino play to accomplish. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was late 1960, however, and he wanted to share the results of his investi- gations based on removing the fives with colleagues. The completion of this analysis would have to wait. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had submitted a paper on the \'93five-count strategy\'94 system to the American Mathematical Society annual meeting in Washington, D. C. The paper had been accepted for presentation. Oakley was only mildly surprised at this. After all, he was on staff at MIT, and the content of the paper was obviously not quackery, despite its dealing with a casino gambling game. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 An Associated Press editor in D. C. perusing the program for the meeting saw the beguiling if somewhat presumptuous title of Oakley\'92s presentation, \'93Fortune\'92s Formula: The Game of Blackjack,\'94 and directed AP staff in Boston to write an article about this young mathematician who promised gold that could be mined in every casino using only mental picks and shovels. A 
\f2\i Boston Globe 
\f1\i0 writer by the name of Dick Stewart called Oakley in the late evening of January 24 for a phone interview. A photographer was sent to his home. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As I said, the next morning, Wednesday, January 25, a front page article appeared in the 
\f2\i Globe 
\f1\i0 and quickly thereafter newspapers across the country. The page 3 
\f2\i Washington Post 
\f1\i0 article by Thomas Wolfe the same day, based on a second telephone interview with Oakley, quoted Oakley as saying, \'93Frankly, I would welcome a wealthy backer or a gambling casino itself to finance me in what we might call the acid test of my theory. I haven\'92t been able to accumulate the capital to undertake it on my own.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Almost instantaneously, the phone calls from rabid gamblers began. They continued throughout the day and night from all over the country. By 4:00 a.m. Oakley was a wreck. He had found himself in a world as foreign as those of other planets of which he, as an astronomy buff, had wondered, but he knew he wanted to test the system and was going to present his paper and see the thing through. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The venue in the Willard Hotel where Oakley was to give his presentation was typical of academic meetings, a large ballroom divided into spaces for three separate academic presentations by portable partitions. It was in fact the appropriately named Grand Ballroom. On the slightly raised stage that served as a dais, a sign on the front of the lecture podium for the speaker provided the name of the meeting and the hotel,

\fs32 \cf3 A large screen behind the speaker displayed slides, and the speaker held a push button device to allow him to guide the slide projector to display the next or previous slides. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 What distinguished Oakley\'92s presentation from all others at this meeting was the number of those attending. More than one hundred people filled the chairs, others stood along the walls, and still others stood in the hall outside the room. This was, I repeat, a mathematics convention. The press coverage had generated major interest, and was to change the direction and import of Oakley\'92s life.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley stood behind the podium. The screen behind him displayed a slide showing tables of numbers and a large multi-colored pie chart. Each table had the title \'93The Five-Count Strategy for Blackjack.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The moderator for the session stood to his side. Incredibly rare for an academic meeting, two photographers were taking photographs of Oakley, their flashbulbs popping. Julian Braun sat in the first row, wearing a name badge identifying him as a registered meeting participant. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The question was, although the five-count strategy works, doesn\'92t the low rate of winning make it impractical,\'94 said Oakley, directing his comments to the audience. \'93It\'92s certainly true that the rate of winning is low. You have a three-and-one-half percent advantage over the house if all four five-value cards have been played.\'94 He pointed to the slide on the screen. \'93But as my table four shows, that only happens about six times out of one hundred hands that you play.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The session moderator pointed to a man in the audience.\uc0\u8232 \'93Question for Dr. Thorp.\'94\u8232 I always wondered at the use of the term \'93moderator\'94 to refer to the facili- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 tators of sessions at an academic meeting. It reminded me of the moderator rods inserted into nuclear reactors to absorb neutrons and control, that is, moderate, the fission rate and therefore power output, preventing annihila- tion of life on Earth. At meetings, the \'93moderator\'94 would presumably prevent uncontrolled disagreement between academics leading to intellectual rage and consequent cerebral meltdown. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The man in the audience spoke. \'93It\'92s easy to keep track of the number of fives that have been played,\'94 he said. \'93Wouldn\'92t appreciably more complicated systems be impossible to memorize? Would you have to essentially carry around a portable computer?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Members of the audience laughed at the absurdity of such a concept. In the early 1960s the only computing machines were main frame computers which, because of the primitive electronics, literally filled entire rooms. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s a good point,\'94 admitted Oakley. \'93The question was essentially that if systems more sophisticated than the five count strategy get developed will the player be able to manage the calculations in his head or will a portable computing machine be necessary?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The person asking the question nodded in agreement. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think both will occur,\'94 continued Oakley. \'93I think the most complex systems that will be developed will require a portable computer. However, simplified versions of the systems would be amenable to mental calculation. In fact I\'92m now working on a system which I call the ten-count strategy. Here the player tracks all the ten-value cards that have been played and 
\fs24 \

\fs32 computes the ratio of non-ten-value cards to ten-value cards remaining in the deck. It\'92s more complicated than the five-count strategy, but it can still be memorized.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The moderator pointed to another man in the audience.\uc0\u8232 \'93Question for Dr. Thorp?\'94 he asked.\u8232 \'93Sure,\'94 said the man in the audience. \'93If you\'92re a rocket scientist.\'94\u8232 The audience laughed at this remark, not because it was inappropriate but 
\fs24 \

\fs32 because the man, in his non-academic manner of speaking, was thought by most in attendance to probably be correct. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Although those presenting papers or sponsoring booths typically must pay a fee to attend academic meetings, the publicity generated for Oakley\'92s presentation had persuaded the session organizers to allow the general public to attend. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You admit there\'92s a low rate of winning, and maybe you\'92d need to carry around a machine on your back,\'94 the man continued. \'93Tell me, these electronic machine calculations are nice, but I don\'92t think it\'92ll work in practice. Have you left your ivory tower in the sky to really try any of your so-called systems in a real casino, Mr. Thorp? I mean, a real casino.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Members of the audience laughed and Oakley cringed. He had fought to keep his session open only to the press and academics, but the session organiz- ers prevailed. Oakley was now paying, having to endure the unenlightened commentary from one who was obviously not in the field of mathematics. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The audience laughed again, this time with a bit of mockery. Oakley was getting upset. He felt that the moderator should have put this fellow\'92s questioning at rest. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Look, it\'92s mathematics,\'94 Oakley said, now feeling he was back in the neighborhood facing an imminent street fight. \'93The mathematical details will be in my paper. It works. I don\'92t have to prove anything to you. It works.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The audience responded to this with increasing laughter. A few catcalls were heard. The moderator decided it was time to terminate the presentation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93One more question for Dr. Thorp,\'94 he said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian had been listening to the interchange and had raised his hand. The moderator, noting that Julian wore a registration badge and was most likely not a layperson, pointed to him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Can you estimate the errors in your expectation values resulting from the approximations that you made in your computer program?\'94 he asked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was glad to finally get an intelligent, relevant question. Hopefully the non-mathematician badgering was over.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yeah,\'94 he said. \'93Actually, no. I would hope that the errors are small if they exist at all. My programs are free from bugs, I know that. And the system works. I can\'92t estimate the errors because more powerful systems haven\'92t been developed yet.\'94 Oakley was still irritated, and he was unhappy that he wasn\'92t able to properly answer the question. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why don\'92t you do it?\'94 he challenged Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The audience felt that the prey had been cornered and was fighting for his life. They laughed and uttered more catcalls. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93With that,\'94 the moderator said, \'93We\'92re going to take a twenty-minute break before our next session.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The audience rose from their seats, and various groups began to converse. Oakley removed his slides from the slide projector, gathered his notes, and walked off the dais. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A group of about fifteen to twenty descended on Oakley. Oakley looked at them hoping they weren\'92t vultures and hyenas coming to remove what was left on the bones. He had hoped the attacks were over. He feared, however, that they would begin anew. Some of them, judging from their ready notepads and pencils, were reporters. Julian stood to the side. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dr. Thorp,\'94 said one of the reporters. At least he\'92s addressing me with respect, thought Oakley. \'93Joe Sherman, 
\f2\i The New York Times
\f1\i0 . You said that blackjack players could win regularly with your system. Can you translate that into cash?\'94 It was a reasonable question. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It depends on your minimum wager,\'94 replied Oakley. \'93If it\'92s one dollar, I think winning one hundred dollars in an hour playing heads-up against the dealer would be possible.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dick Stewart, 
\f2\i Boston Globe
\f1\i0 ,\'94 said another. Oakley remembered the name as the reporter who had written a long piece about him and his work in the 
\f2\i Globe 
\f1\i0 that morning. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s a very optimistic claim,\'94 said Stewart. \'93I\'92m going to ask the same question that was asked before. You haven\'92t actually tried your system in a casino. Do you ever plan to?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, hello,\'94 said Oakley, trying to stay on good terms, despite the potential dangerous implication of the question. \'93My biographer. Thanks for the article in today\'92s paper. At least that was nice. To answer your question, Dick, I haven\'92t tried the five-count strategy yet. I\'92ve tried the system developed by Baldwin and his colleagues and the results were very suggestive.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But you haven\'92t tried your system,\'94 persisted Stewart. \'93And what do you mean by \'91suggestive?\'92\'94 Oakley, to his dismay, had apparently found a new enemy. He tried humor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I tried it in Lake Tahoe when I was a graduate student and didn\'92t lose all of my money,\'94 joked Oakley, smiling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At least the group laughed, and Stewart was silenced. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Actually, I made $8.50,\'94 Oakley continued. \'93But everyone else at the table lost all of theirs.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Allen Weinrub.

\f1\i0 ,\'94 said another reporter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dr. Thorp, you haven\'92t tried your first system in a casino. Do you plan on soon trying out your new system in a casino? The ten-count strategy.\'94 That was a reasonable question. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t think so. I\'92m a mathematician, not a gambler,\'94 Oakley replied. He had discovered an effective way of deflecting the embarrassing questions about trying out the system in the casinos. \'93It\'92s not my world. And remember, in the short run you can lose money. Even if I had the urge, I\'92d need to be bankrolled. University professors can\'92t afford to lose $500 in a casino.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Our editorial today read,\'94 continued Mr. Weinrub. He started to read, and it was apparent he was going in for the kill. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s a mathematician in town who says he has a system for beating blackjack. It reminds us of an ad we answered. Send only one dollar for a surefire weed killer. Back came an envelope with a piece of paper saying \'91Grab by the roots and pull like hell.\'92 Would you like to comment on that?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley tried the humor-deflection technique.\uc0\u8232 \'93I\'92m mathematician, not a botanist.\'94\u8232 The group laughed at this witticism. His theory may not work, they might 
\fs24 \

\fs32 have thought, but he\'92s a good enough guy.\uc0\u8232 The first reporter, Sherman, wouldn\'92t relent.\u8232 \'93How do your colleagues at MIT view these pursuits of yours?\'94 he asked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s a lot of skepticism in this hall about the whole thing. How do they feel?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, they\'92re not willing to bankroll me, if that\'92s what you mean.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Some of the group laughed, but they were getting tired of Oakley acting like a sleaze politician, avoiding the questions. Some muttered non-niceties under their breath. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The students love it,\'94 said Oakley sensing the growing antagonism. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Stewart dove in. \'93Is it true, Professor Thorp,\'94 he said, with notable sarcasm in referring to Oakley by his professional title, \'93that your colleagues in the math department view your non-traditional research unfavorably and that far from getting tenure your contract for next year may not be . . .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had endured enough. The humor didn\'92t work. The sympathy- engendering comment about low faculty salaries didn\'92t work. The reference to his admiring students didn\'92t work. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No more questions,\'94 he said, walking away. \'93Thank you very much.\'94 \'93Dr. Thorp . . .,\'94 said Sherman, wanting more.\uc0\u8232 \'93No more questions,\'94 said Oakley.

\fs32 \cf3 The three reporters thanked Oakley and let him go as the group dispersed. Oakley walked quickly away through the ballroom/lecture hall. Julian ran up to him and confronted him in the aisle. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think you\'92re wrong,\'94 said Julian. \'93The approximations you had to make, even if incorrect by only two or five percent, would dominate your expectation values.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Excuse me?\'94 replied a nearly shellshocked Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley continued to walk and reached the hallway outside the ballroom. Julian followed him like a new puppy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I read the Baldwin paper, too,\'94 he said. \'93I think your counting fives is a major advance over their results.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why, thank you,\'94 said Oakley, his despair over his treatment in the hall transforming into sarcasm. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But you must have used a 704,\'94 said Julian. \'93It\'92s obvious from all the approximations you had to make. You\'92re hampered by it like the Baldwin group was hampered by using only their Friden calculators. And your code is probably inefficient.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian, not the most socially adept, was perceptive and obviously knowledge- able. The quality of Oakley\'92s work was in fact diminished by his having to use the computer available at MIT, and he had needed to make approximations. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Then, my friend, like I said, develop a new system . . .,\'94 said Oakley looking at Julian\'92s name badge, \'93Mr. Julian Braun.\'94 Oakley should have been more receptive to Julian, although his rudeness was understandable after his treat- ment in the hall. He knew that Julian had accurately analyzed the quality of his work. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mr. Julian Braun, M.S,\'94 said Braun, standing up to Oakley. \'93You\'92re not the only intelligent person in this hall. I work at IBM\'92s facility in Chicago. I have access to a 7044.\'94 That was Julian\'92s final attempt. He had shot the biggest shell in his arsenal right at Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley stopped walking. He had been struck.\uc0\u8232 \'93A 7044?\'94 he said with a glint in his eyes.\u8232 \'93I\'92m not interested in gambling. If you let me take a look at your code, I\'92m 
\fs24 \

\fs32 sure I can avoid the approximations and shortcuts,\'94 added Julian, firing another computer salvo. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A 7044?\'94 Oakley was thinking of the consequences of using such a machine for his work. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s right. I\'92m a programmer. I\'92d like a copy of your FORTRAN code.\'94 \'93A 7044?\'94

\fs32 \cf3 The office of the MIT math department on the first floor of Building 2 was in room 2-106. This in itself would pose an enigma to the first-time visitor. Clearly, a room with the name 2-106 would be on the second floor. When Oakley first came to the campus, he expected the mathematics building to have the name of a wealthy New Englander who had endowed the university with a large gift. Instead, he found the name, literally Building 2, to be even less enchanting, if possible, than the name Mathematics Sciences building that he had known as a student and then in his teaching position at UCLA. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The office, 2-106, which was on the first floor, was decorated in neo- classical musky, with brown painted plaster walls with some narrow wood trim and several metal desks. A clock on the wall read 9:15 a.m. The calendar said it was Monday, as if those coming to the math department after the cold Massachusetts January weekend didn\'92t know. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As all academic offices are, this office was functional. A swinging door would open at the far right end of a counter stretching from left to right a few feet beyond the door to the hallway. At the left end of the counter a large rect- angular metal box attached to the wall housed a mailbox. It had twenty-four mail slots with pieces of paper with the names of faculty members glued to the base of the respective slots. Underneath those slots were about forty smaller slots for the graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Magazines, letters, and note slips sat in the various mail slots. Oakley\'92s mail slot was empty. Oakley stood at the mailbox. He stuck his hand into his mail slot and moved it around to make sure no piece of mail was lying flat in it. Jane Rose, the department secretary, sat at a desk on the other side of the

\fs32 \'93No mail?\'94 asked Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh, yeah,\'94 Jane replied.\u8232 \'93My mail box is empty,\'94 noted a puzzled Oakley.\u8232 \'93Oh, it\'92s in the sack behind the counter.\'94\u8232 \'93Sack?\'94\u8232 \'93There was way too much for your mailbox.\'94\u8232 \'93Anything important?\'94 Oakley was surprised by Jane\'92s comment, but 
\fs24 \

\fs32 then realized his talk and the newspaper coverage may have generated some responses. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No,\'94 said Jane. \'93Just the usual invitations to appear on What\'92s My Line, To Tell the Truth, and Truth or Consequences.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Really?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And a couple hundred reprint requests for your upcoming paper on black- jack. Maybe a thousand. Who counts?\'94 You could see Jane\'92s personality shin- ing. She continued. \'93Letters from gangster and bookie types. To take a class on gambling no doubt. Fan mail. Some are female admirers judging from the clouds of perfume.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stratus or cumulonimbus?\'94 said Oakley, getting into the spirit of the morning. The unaccustomed stress of the days leading up to his presentation, and the grilling after his presentation, had tired his body and dulled his spirit, but after a weekend back in Brookline with Vivian he was refreshed, and his smart-aleck nature was rejuvenated. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, you lady-killer mathematicians.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And there\'92s a man who called and says he\'92s an electrical engineer and says he developed a better system than your system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, how nice. What\'92s his name?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Harvey Dubner. He says he\'92s going to send you a copy of his work.\'94 \'93Okay. Anything else?\'94\u8232 \'93Oh, this is the really important one. Vivian called and said don\'92t forget the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 bananas and milk.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Thank God. I almost forgot. Jane, can you take care of the reprint requests?\'94 \'93Already done.\'94\u8232 \'93What a dear,\'94 said Oakley, expressing his affection for Jane. \'93The astron- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 omy department\'92s loss is our gain.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, we\'92ve got celebrity here.\'94\u8232 She handed him a handful of pink message slips and a small stack of letters. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here are the phone call slips and what I think are the mobster letters,\'94 Jane said. \'93I was almost, almost I say, tempted to open them up. I\'92m sure they make great reading.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley began to walk out the door with the letters. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They might make excellent students,\'94 he said. \'93But you probably made a good decision. Your life may have been at risk.\'94 He stopped walking. He handed Jane some of the letters. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here, you can keep the perfumed letters. My life would be at risk if I took them home.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure,\'94 agreed Jane. \'93There were some phone calls that, well, weren\'92t very nice. Critical, you know.\'94 Oakley could have expected that. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And there\'92s one guy who keeps on calling. He doesn\'92t sound like a gang- ster. He says he wants to visit you next week.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Julian Braun from Chicago?\'94 Jane was taken aback.\uc0\u8232 \'93You can read minds? Mathematicians are taught how to read minds?\'94 \'93Only some of us. It was an honors course.\'94

\fs24 \

\fs32 The blackboard in Lecture Hall 112, Building 2 \'96 officially room 2-112 \'96 was full of drawings sketched with chalk of square grids similar to rectangular graph paper. One drawing had a conically shaped figure drawn to simulate it penetrating through the graph paper, with the words \'93wormhole\'94 identifying the cone. Next to it was a drawing with the graph paper drawn as if it were bending around on itself, with the wormhole cone shrinking and then enlarg- ing and opening back onto a different part of the drawing. Numerous equa- tions were written next to the drawings. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A clock hung on the wall above the center of the blackboard. It was five minutes to eleven o\'92clock. Oakley\'92s lecture notes lay on a non-descript wooden lectern in front of the blackboard, and his briefcase was propped up next to the lectern. Oakley stood at the blackboard holding a piece of chalk, address- ing his twenty-five or so students sitting in the classroom. Julian, cradling a bulky, large manila envelope in his lap, sat in the back row. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The two spaces are equivalent mathematically, simple topological transfor- mations,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Now, physically, they represent different phenomena, as you can see.\'94 He pointed to the first diagram. \'93Here the singularity is iso- lated. Here,\'94 he said pointing to the second diagram, \'93its nodes are located in two different regions of the manifold. Separated by arbitrary distances depending on the value of the stretching parameter, kappa. But it\'92s the same singularity.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 He looked up at the clock above the blackboard. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, I\'92m running over. We\'92ll, we\'92ll talk about the possibility of using those wormholes for interstellar travel next time. I assume you are interested in interstellar travel?\'94 he teased. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The students rose from their seats and left. Oakley placed his lecture notes into his briefcase as Julian walked up to him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good stuff,\'94 Julian observed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It keeps them from falling asleep,\'94 said Oakley wryly. He pointed to one of the students leaving the lecture hall. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But that Alan Guth kid. Bright kid.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They walked out of the lecture room, into the corridor, and down the hall into Oakley\'92s office. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s good that the physics students take these classes,\'94 he continued. \'93Shows the math students that there\'92s a reason for their existence.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian laughed. \'93Right. Math is the language of physics.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I just wish some of the finance or economics students here would enroll,\'94 stated Oakley. \'93These are powerful tools. I\'92m sure they could be applied.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why don\'92t they enroll?\'94 asked Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think the finance majors are too busy picking stocks,\'94 claimed Oakley, \'93and I think the economics students are too busy working with their faculty advisors, falling over each other with their hare-brained theories trying to win Nobel Prizes.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s a great word in Yiddish for that,\'94 offered Julian. \'93
\f2\i Fakakta 
\f1\i0 theory.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93
\f2\i Fakakta
\f1\i0 ,\'94 Oakley let the word staccato out of his mouth. \'93
\f2\i Fakakta 
\f1\i0 theory. Great. I gotta tell that to my wife. She\'92s Jewish, you know, but her parents were from Hungary so they didn\'92t speak much Yiddish.\'94 He laughed at the thought. \'93A 
\f2\i fakakta 
\f1\i0 theory.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They walked into Oakley\'92s office and Oakley placed his briefcase on a shelf. He picked up a few darts and started throwing them against a dartboard on the wall next to the door. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Very relaxing,\'94 said Oakley, throwing a dart. \'93I always try for the seven- teen and nineteen at the bottom. Even with the three, the expectation value is thirteen.\'94 He threw a second dart. \'93Better odds than trying for the twenty. See,\'94 he said, pointing to the top sector of the cart board, \'93bracketed by the one and five. Expectation value of less than nine.\'94 He threw the third dart. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Forty-four,\'94 he announced to the cheering crowd. \'93My all-time record is one hundred and forty-eight. Two triple nineteens and a double seventeen. It\'92s a game I made up to help me relax, unwind,\'94 he reminded Julian, as if excusing himself for his non-academic diversion. \'93I throw three darts and simply tally up the total. First of me to two hundred wins.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 He pointed to the dart board. \'93See . . . seventeen plus thirteen plus double seven. Forty-four.\'94 Oakley had taught himself to play tennis and had made the varsity tennis team in high school. He was competitive, even if the two competitors were both himself. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 His office typified that of the creative academic intellect. Shelves were full of journals, books, reprints of articles, and manuscripts, and his desk was piled high with journals. Nonetheless, he could finger through the journals to find any article that he might need. A framed photo of Vivian hugging him taken by Allan at Larry Toy\'92s restaurant had found a clear area on which to reside on one corner of the desk. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 While Oakley was amusing himself, Julian had placed his large manila envelope on Oakley\'92s desk and had opened it up. He pulled out a notebook and handed it to Oakley, now seated in the swivel chair behind his desk. The notebook contained hundreds of sheets of computer printout. Julian reclined in a wooden frame chair meant for student office-hour visitors. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93First,\'94 said Julian, \'93the 7044 has much larger working memory than the 704 you used. I saved a lot of timing by using arrays with larger dimensions than having to do a simulation, store the data on magnetic disk, reinitiate the vari- ables, and start over. Then when I need to do comparisons, I don\'92t have to read the data off the disk. And this way I avoid read errors, although they\'92re rare.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was aware of the advanced computing abilities of the 7044, con- firmed by their telephone conversations, but he let Julian continue as he looked through the sheets of computer printout in Julian\'92s notebook. 
\fs24 \

\fs24 Never Split Tens 
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 \'93It also permits more nested DO LOOPS so I can use those variables of more dimensions that you could with the 704,\'94 said Julian, as if speaking of a child of whom he was proud, but a bit apprehensive about Oakley\'92s response to his work. \'93I can store simultaneously the number of cards played, the num- ber of hands played, the number of cards of each value played, the number of unseen cards that have been dealt, and so on. I don\'92t have to approximate any of these parameters. If I wanted to, I could even distinguish the suits of the cards. But this is blackjack and not poker or gin.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Perhaps someday variations in the game, or side bets, may involve colors and suits,\'94 observed Oakley. He remembered fondly the three-card flush he had announced to the dealer at Barney\'92s. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The code you wrote for your five-count and ten-count strategy is interest- ing, what you call the \'91arbitrary subset\'92 approach,\'94 said Julian, \'93but with the 7044 I didn\'92t have to make approximations so I\'92ve revised some of it.\'94 He pointed to one of the computer printouts at the beginning of the notebook. \'93See? The results speak for themselves.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley continued to leaf through the notebook of computer printout Julian had placed on his desk. Julian continued, confident but still apprehen- sive about Oakley\'92s response to his work. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m using essentially the same methods and techniques that you devel- oped and used to work out both the five-count and your more sophisticated and quite powerful ten-count strategy systems,\'94 Julian said. He wanted to make sure that Oakley knew that. \'93The ultimate results will be more compli- cated, but hopefully with some simplification can generate something easily memorized.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley knew that had been the plan. He politely raised his hand to silence Julian as he continued examining the computer printout. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian pointed to the page that Oakley was reading. \'93As you suggested, I removed one Ace from the deck, and these ten tables show the resulting player\'92s advantages, one table for each of the dealer\'92s possible ten up-cards,\'94 he said. \'93Then I removed two Aces from the deck, and generated another ten tables. And I did the same thing, removing from one to four of every card, and then the sixteen ten-value cards.\'94 This was what Oakley had begun doing his honeymoon night, but he was using a pencil and a piece of paper. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So we have ten times fifty-two or five hundred and twenty tables,\'94 said Julian. \'93Each with ten entries for splitting and fifty-five entries both for dou- bling down and drawing or standing, one for each of the fifty-five possible player\'92s two-card hands, including pairs. That\'92s a total of one hundred and twenty entries in each of five hundred and twenty tables. More than sixty thousand probabilities to calculate by a Monte Carlo simulation. Actually, it\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 not quite that large because the dealer has a card. If he or she has a six show- ing, for example, I can only pull out the three remaining sixes, so it\'92s really five hundred and ten tables. And you\'92ve got to include the possibility of multiple splitting of pairs.\'94 He waited for Oakley\'92s response. \'93I brought all the tables along,\'94 Julian crowed, slapping the notebook. \'93It took the 7044 about a half an hour to an hour.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The Four Horsemen of Aberdeen estimated they spent four thousand hours calculating their strategy,\'94 said Oakley. \'93To have performed these cal- culations would have taken fifty-one times as long, more than two hundred thousand hours. The basic strategy doesn\'92t account for the cards that have been removed from the deck.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Gad. Working six hours a day, three hundred days a year, that would have taken . . .,\'94 said Julian, pausing for a second to perform the mental arithmetic, \'93more than one hundred years.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They wouldn\'92t have made much of a dent even by now,\'94 concluded Oakley. \'93They would have needed all the king\'92s horses and all the king\'92s men, and they still wouldn\'92t have been able to . . . whatever.\'94 Oakley failed to find a statisti- cally relevant metaphor for Humpty Dumpty, but Julian understood. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If you want to examine the use of multiple decks, you have that many more tables,\'94 Julian said, looking perhaps for an extension of a non-existent contract with Oakley. Actually, he just wanted to let Oakley know he was eager to continue the work and enjoyed working with him, not only because they shared a common interest but also because Oakley was a rare item, a mathematician celebrity, even if he was a lousy apprentice poet. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Multiple decks, right,\'94 agreed Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here.\'94 Julian flipped through several hundred pages of printout. \'93I also calculated the dealer\'92s probabilities of getting standing hands or busting not just for the entire deck but as the cards are dealt,\'94 said Julian, pointing to a particular page. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I did the programming, now it\'92s your time to use the data,\'94 noted Julian, stretching out his arms to take a brief break from his presentation. \'93And to put it in a format that can be used in the casino.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good,\'94 said Oakley, relishing the creative challenge. \'93Let me tell you what I\'92ve been doing. My motivation for developing the five-count strategy system was my finding that removing the fives from the deck provided the greatest advantage to the player. In developing the ten-count strategy, I was aware of the crucial effect of the tens in affecting the advantages to the player. Now I follow what Harvey Dubner did.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That fellow who contacted you after the convention?\'94

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yeah. He\'92s done some very good work.\'94\uc0\u8232 Oakley opened his desk drawer and pulled out an index card.\u8232 \'93Here\'92s a 3 by 5 index card he sent me with his results. He called the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 twos through sixes the \'91lows\'92 and the ten-value cards and Aces the \'91highs.\'92 In other words, although removing the fives from the deck provided the greatest advantage to the player, now we group the twos, threes, fours, and sixes in the same class. Similarly, now we group the Aces in the same class as the tens. They\'92re also important. Dubner kept track of the number of each type of card that was played and seen and then subtracted the number of lows that were left to be played from the number of highs left to be played. It\'92s the difference between the two types of cards that remain that he found to be significant. It\'92s the basis of what Harvey Dubner called the \'91Basic Hi-Lo Strategy.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nice. In effect, he said that all the lows had the same effect and all the highs had the same effect,\'94 observed Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s exactly right,\'94 responded Oakley. \'93Now, can we quantify this rather than subtracting the number of each class of card dealt? I said sure, it\'92s easier to just assign values to the cards. I assign a point value of +1 to the twos through sixes as they are played and seen by the player and one of \uc0\u8722 1 to the ten-value cards and Aces as they are played and seen. What I call the point total or total point count, or just point count for short, is the arithmetic sum of the point values of the cards that were played and seen, the total point value of the cards. In the end, you remember only one number, the sum.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Instead of two numbers, the number of highs and lows remaining,\'94 noted Julian. \'93Easier to do.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right. It\'92s as simple as the Goren point count in bridge.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93What about the cards that are played and not seen,\'94 asked Julian.\u8232 \'93If you don\'92t see them, you can\'92t include them in the count. They\'92re consid- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ered as not being played,\'94 responded Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93And, what about the sevens, eights, and nines?\'94 Julian asked.\u8232 \'93Even my calculations with the 704 showed that they have small effects, so 
\fs24 \

\fs32 I gave them a point value of zero. Harvey in effect did the same by excluding them from the categories of \'91highs\'92 and \'91lows.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian flipped through his notebook. He pointed to one of the computer printout pages. \'93The 7044 calculations agree. They\'92re relatively neutral in affecting the player\'92s advantages. It\'92s easier just to assign a point value of zero.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. The small increase in sensitivity isn\'92t worth the cerebral labor.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Adding up the plus ones, minus ones, zeroes, and so on is a very nice con- cise way of quantifying the remaining cards,\'94 noted Julian. \'93We\'92re essentially 
\fs24 \

\fs32 reducing the game to a two-type-of-card game, two classes of cards. You and Harvey are very clever, Ed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Harvey thanks you. I thank you. My teachers thank you. My thesis com- mittee thanks you. I guess my wife thanks you,\'94 said Oakley, lightening up from his professorial chores. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re welcome,\'94 said Julian, perfunctorily. He was gracious, but he was now thinking of how this scheme could organize the multitude of his calcula- tions and make it more palatable to Oakley. \'93Each of my card removal tables corresponds to zero, plus one, minus one, or a multiple.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He lifted his notebook from Oakley\'92s desk and let it drop onto the desk, creating an audible thud. \'93Instead of considering each of my five hundred and ten tables separately, we can essentially combine them based on their point count,\'94 said an obviously relieved Julian. \'93This greatly simplifies any analysis.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He stood up and raised his forefinger to the air. \'93Mr. Braun is happy to announce that you won\'92t need an electronic computing machine strapped to your back to apply the system in the casino. He suggests that you simply add and subtract plus and minus ones.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed at Julian\'92s out-of-character antic. He had sensed Julian\'92s apprehension and was now happy that Julian was relieved of that burden. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley turned to two computer printout sheets in Julian\'92s notebook. \'93Exactly. Here are two of your tables, one generated by removing five ten- value cards and this one generated by removing three of the deuces. The point count is minus five plus two, for a total of \uc0\u8722 3. The same point count results if the dealer had dealt out, say, twelve ten-value cards and nine of the low-value cards. To use your data, we only need know that the point count is \u8722 3, not which particular cards have been played. That would be nice to keep track of, an ultimate, ultimate system, but the typical player would not tolerate the challenge. I wouldn\'92t.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nor I,\'94 agreed Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian knew well that, as good as his results were, the ability to use them in the casino, put them in a casino-friendly \'93format,\'94 make it palatable as I said, was one of Oakley\'92s major motivations, if not his single most important one after, of course, developing the mathematics of the system. This concept of the point count had made using his voluminous calculations practical, if still requiring some mental arithmetic. The theoretician in him, unfortunately, led him to suggest even greater complexity. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You would get a greater discrimination among decks if you assigned dif- ferent point values to some of the cards,\'94 offered Julian. In thinking about the plus-minus scheme, he had considered such an option. 
\fs24 \

\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley had thought of this himself. \'93Sure,\'94 he agreed. \'93The five-count strategy was based on their absence providing the best advantage to the player of any card, so I could assign, say, +2 to the fives, and because the absence of Aces is disadvantageous I could assign \uc0\u8722 2 to them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But, will this really generate an improved discrimination in the quality of the deck? I don\'92t think so. First, they burn a card, which you can\'92t see to include in the count. That by itself introduces an uncertainty. If it\'92s a five or an Ace, the error could be plus or minus two instead of plus or minus one. The mistakes you\'92ll inevitably be making in counting the cards introduces more uncertainty in the count if the absolute value of some are increased, and mak- ing the system more complex will tire the player and increase the frequency of those errors.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But if the errors are random and relatively few, it shouldn\'92t affect the play- er\'92s expectation values.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. In the long run, but not necessarily in the short run, right? So I\'92ve concluded that any marginal improvement in discriminating, as I said, differences in the quality of decks might not be realized. In short, it\'92s what I think is just an unjustifiably more difficult calculation,\'94 he concluded. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Which you want to do in your head,\'94 noted Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93In the heat of the battle, so to speak,\'94 agreed Oakley. \'93You want to do it quickly, effortlessly really. Unless you want to sit there using a sheet of paper and pencil and tip the casino off that you\'92re playing this system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Or wear an electronic computing machine on your back,\'94 added Julian. He repeated the witticism, happy that Oakley had rejected a more com- plex counting scheme. He could only have imagined the computing he might have been asked to perform. As much pleasure as it gave him, IBM, after all, wasn\'92t paying him to run blackjack simulations. Julian knew how a think tank works, and IBM was to a large degree a think tank. The algorithms that he was developing and using to analyze blackjack might indeed be applicable to work that IBM might now or in the future con- sider relevant. IBM was a business, however, not a university where aca- demics can pursue their research interests, no matter how unconventional, arcane, or even unpopular with colleagues they may be. At least, Julian had repeatedly reassured himself, his supervisors had never complained about his hobby. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 While Julian was immersed in his thoughts, Oakley was immersed in his. Ever since he had played Baldwin\'92s system, using that cheat sheet which the dealers and other players mocked, Oakley believed that the effect of removing 
\fs24 \

\f0\b \cf3 11 Braun\'92s Brawn 
\fs26\fsmilli13333 93

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 various types of cards would change the advantage to the player. He thought about his comments on the drive home with Vivian, Allan, and Joan, about his dealing hands to himself on his honeymoon night, and about the hours at UCLA he had spent trying to devise a system by hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley took off his glasses, walked over to his blackboard, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote down a formula. He addressed the classroom. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Now, Julian, in what I call the simple point count system I used the point count only as a rough guide to betting and as an approximate indicator to the player of doubling down and splitting more frequently and of standing more frequently when the point count was large and positive, and to do the opposite when it\'92s negative,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Other than that the system follows the guidelines for playing my recalculation of Baldwin\'92s group\'92s system, what I call the \'91basic strategy.\'92 In it, we only consider the dealer\'92s up-card and the player\'92s two cards.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93With the more precise results from your 7044, we\'92re now justified in using the point count to calculate an index to guide the strategy decisions. It\'92s what I call the advanced or complete point count strategy,\'94 Oakley announced. \'93Borrowing Harvey\'92s \'91Hi-Lo\'92 terminology, I also call it the \'91high-low strategy.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The \'91high-low strategy.\'92 I like that,\'94 said Julian. \'93The index?\'94 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 Never Split Tens 
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yeah, it\'92s just a small additional bit of mental math needed. I divide the point count by the number of cards left in the deck and multiply by 100,\'94 Oakley lectured. \'93See,\'94 he said pointing to the equation he had written on the blackboard. \'93The high-low index, 
\f2\i I
\f1\i0 , equals 100 
\f2\i c
\f1\i0 /
\f2\i n
\f1\i0 , where 
\f2\i c 
\f1\i0 is the point count and 
\f2\i n 
\f1\i0 is the number of cards left to be played. I multi- ply by 100 to provide an integer result rather than a fraction. If you don\'92t see a card, you don\'92t include it in either the point count or the number of cards that have been played. The values range most frequently between \uc0\u8722 25 to +25.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good. Catchy,\'94 said Julian. He let the phrase roll off of his tongue. \'93The high-low index.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A deck of 
\f2\i n 
\f1\i0 = 20 cards with a point count of +2 is richer, so to speak, in cards favoring the player than a deck with 
\f2\i n 
\f1\i0 = 40 cards left with the same point count,\'94 continued Oakley. \'93Conversely, a deck of 20 cards with a point count of \'962 is poorer in cards favoring the player than one with 40 cards left. So you need to remember two numbers, the point count and the number of cards that have been played and viewed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Harvey considered this in his hi-lo system,\'94 noted Julian, pointing to Dubner\'92s 3 \'d7 5 index card. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. It\'92s very similar to Harvey\'92s \'91Hi-Lo Index,\'92\'94 agreed Oakley, looking at the 3 \'d7 5 index card. \'93As I said, he subtracted the number of low-value cards left in the deck from the number of high-value cards left in the deck, and then he divided as I do by the number of cards remaining to be played. I followed his lead. He called it the \'91Hi-Lo Index\'92 and used it to determine his bet size and hard drawing and standing strategy, but he didn\'92t then multiply by 100. Without that you\'92re left with decimal results and it becomes challenging to use I think.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I tend to agree,\'94 said Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93His calculation of the \'91Hi-Lo index\'92 and my calculation of the \'91high-low index\'92 give the same result. Let\'92s say three ten-value cards and Aces and five low-value cards have been played. My point count would be \uc0\u8722 3 plus +5 or +2 and the high-low index would be +2 divided by 44 times 100. Harvey\'92s Hi-Lo Index would be calculated as the original 20 high-value cards minus the 3 played or 17 high-value cards left in the deck, minus the number of low-value cards left in the deck, the original 20 minus the 5 played, or 15. And then subtracting the two gives 17 \'96 15 or +2, just as I would calculate.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian rose and went to the blackboard. \'93Yeah, it\'92s trivial to show they\'92re equivalent except for the multiplication by 100,\'94 he said. \'93Here,\'94 he wrote as he spoke, \'93let 
\f2\i H 
\f1\i0 be the number of high-value cards played and 
\f2\i L 
\f1\i0 be the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 number of low-value cards played, and 
\f2\i N 
\f1\i0 be the number of cards in the com- plete deck, 52. Then you in effect calculate 
\f2\i L 
\f1\i0 \uc0\u8722  
\f2\i H 
\f1\i0 and divide by the number of cards left to be played and Harvey calculates (
\f2\i N 
\f1\i0 \uc0\u8722  
\f2\i H
\f1\i0 ) \uc0\u8722  (
\f2\i N 
\f1\i0 \uc0\u8722  
\f2\i L
\f1\i0 ) = \uc0\u8722  
\f2\i H 
\f1\i0 + 
\f2\i L 
\f1\i0 or the same 
\f2\i L 
\f1\i0 \uc0\u8722  
\f2\i H 
\f1\i0 and again divides by the number of cards left to be played. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I like your method better. As you said, much easier. You can skip three steps counting the cards as they are played rather than calculating the num- ber of cards of each type left to be played and then subtracting them. It has the same added complexity as your ten-count strategy. I don\'92t know if he knew about the ten-count strategy when he was developing his Hi-Lo, but he\'92s using the same way to calculate the index.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The entire concept agrees with intuition,\'94 Oakley noted. You would stand more frequently if the index is positive, meaning you\'92ve got lots of high-value cards left in the deck, but take a hit more frequently if the index is negative, because you have a better probability of drawing a low-value card. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s similar to what I did with the ten-count strategy, where I calculate my ten richness ratio as the ratio of the non-tens to tens which have been played and viewed. But those values with their decimal points make the system cum- bersome to use, challenging. Harvey probably saw the same thing with his Hi-Lo Index.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You must love indices,\'94 noted Julian. \'93Your five-count strategy also calcu- lated an index,\'94 said Julian, remembering Oakley\'92s presentation at the math- ematics meeting. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right, number of unseen cards divided by the number of unseen fives,\'94 said Oakley. \'93But this, Julian, this provides a more precise quantitative means of determining strategy decisions beyond the basic strategy and the five-count based on the quality of the remaining cards. You give me the player\'92s hand and dealer\'92s up-card and all the strategy decisions are determined by this index. And with your results, the guidance will be more precise. I can now create more precise strategy decision numbers for the player related to the high-low index. And I\'92ll also be able to provide a guide, like I did in the ten-count strategy, for taking insurance. Dubner did the same. This is very, very good.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This is more detailed than what Harvey proposed,\'94 added Julian, look- ing at Dubner\'92s 3 \'d7 5 index card. \'93He gave hard and fast rules for splitting, doubling down, and soft drawing and standing, and insurance, as if he were playing the basic strategy. He provided strategy decisions based on values of his Hi-Lo Index for only hard drawing and standing. Yeah, our results will be more detailed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And, as you say, with the 7044 more precise,\'94 added Julian.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley sat in his swivel chair. Then he suddenly pumped his fist in the air in exultation. \'93Holy, holy, holy, Moses . . . Cheese . . . Cow . . . holy Toledo. Ohhh., Julian!\'94 For an atheist, Oakley had a lot of gods. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian was pleased that Oakley was pleased. It was obvious that Oakley was much more, in fact, than simply pleased. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The beauty of a 7044,\'94 said Julian, modestly. He was being more than modest, of course. He wanted to ensure that Oakley knew that he was an indispensable partner. Julian, despite his intellect, was somewhat of a recluse. He could hope that some of Oakley\'92s attributes, a man with a vivacious wife, enviable academic position, and bright future might, if not further his career, at least spice up his life sitting at a desk at IBM. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley sat in his swivel chair and leaned back. He stared at the wall. They had created a monster, if a mathematical rather than biological one. He got back up and walked to the blackboard. He sketched out a rectangular coor- dinate system and wrote \'93
\f2\i E
\f1\i0 \'94 next to the ordinate scale and \'93
\f2\i I
\f1\i0 \'94 next to the abscissa scale. He put a minus sign below the abscissa scale to the left of the origin and a positive sign below the scale to the right of the origin. He drew a continuous line, beginning as a concave upward curve in the third quadrant, straightening out as it approached and passed through the origin, and then continuing as a straight line at close to a 45-degree angle upwards into the first quadrant. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If I made a graph of the expectation value for a one-dollar bet as a func- tion of the high-low index, it would certainly be an increasing function, if you follow the strategy decisions,\'94 said Oakley pointing to the graph, in a capsule summary of their work. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian started to make a comment, but Oakley knew what was coming. He raised his hand. \'93I said \'91if you follow the strategy decisions.\'92 The index will be negative as frequently as it will be positive, but the player will be changing the strategy. You\'92ve got to follow the system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ah, yeah,\'94 said Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And it provides a guide to betting,\'94 Oakley added, in a trance. You bet one-half of the high-low index.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s very interesting,\'94 said Julian. He pointed to the formula Oakley had written on the blackboard. \'93As the deck gets richer in cards favoring the player, he or she should increase the bet, and this provides the formula,\'94 Julian joyfully announced, becoming unable to control his enthusiasm at their mutual tutorial. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Fortune\'92s formula,\'94 added Oakley. \'93Better than the betting concept I had for the simple point count where, in its simplest form, you just bet the total point count, or your minimum bet if the count is zero or negative.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian smiled, remembering that phrase as part of the title of Oakley\'92s paper to the American Mathematical Society meeting. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Lower your bet to a minimum for low or negative values of the index, reducing your expected loss, and increase it when the index is positive, increas- ing your expected winnings,\'94 instructed Oakley. \'93This follows what Harvey suggested in his Hi-Lo system. He suggested $1 bets when the hi-lo index was small or negative, $5 bets when the index was between 0.05 and 0.10, $10 bets when the index was between 0.10 and 0.20, and $20 bets when the index was greater than 0.20.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So he basically said bet half of the upper boundary of the interval of the Hi-Lo Index, multiplied by 100,\'94 concluded Julian. \'93Again, our results will be more detailed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley pointed to the curved line he had drawn on the graph, and drew a second curved line. It began from the origin but curved above the first line he had drawn. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Changing your bets with changing the high-low index increases the expec- tation values even further. I developed a rough scheme on increasing the bet with the ten-count strategy system, but Baldwin\'92s system, my basic strategy, the five-count, and even the simple point count essentially said just to raise the bet when the deck became favorable. Basically raise it as high as possible, except it may tip off the house when you consistently win a large fraction of those large bets,\'94 he said, finishing the lecture to his one-man class on the subject of the high-low index. He sat down, slapping his hands together to dissipate the chalk dust. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian walked over to the dart board against the wall and pulled out Oakley\'92s darts. He walked back about ten feet and threw the darts one by one trying for the bull\'92s eye. The darts stuck on the three, eleven, and eight sectors. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A twenty-two,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Not bad for a first try, Julian. With a little more practice you could be named rookie of the year.\'94 He pointed to his desk. \'93I want to show you something.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now it was time for Oakley\'92s show and tell. He carefully pulled a writing tablet out from the pile of books on his desk and placed it beside Julian\'92s note- book. Julian stared in amazement, not only that Oakley could find the tablet but that the pile of books did not come toppling down. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93These are the tables in the format I devised for my recalculation of Baldwin\'92s system using the 704, what I call the basic strategy, and for my ten- count strategy. The possible dealer\'92s up-cards from two through Ace are along the top row and the player\'92s possible two-card totals starting from twelve up to nineteen are along the left-hand column,\'94 said Oakley, pointing to the top page of the tablet. The entries in the matrix direct the player to draw or

\fs32 \'93The Four Horsemen provided strategy charts in their book with sections on drawing and standing, doubling down, and splitting pairs,\'94 observed Julian. \'93Yours is similar.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, I know,\'94 said Oakley. Here, see, this is the hard drawing and stand- ing table for the basic strategy. With the player holding a 13 or more against the dealer\'92s 3 you stand. If you have less than 13, you take a card. Same hold- ing 12 against her 3.\'94

\fs32 \'93And 14 and 15 and 16,\'94 Oakley added, \'93the heinous, malevolent, mar- ginal hands,\'94 Oakley continued, apparently ascribing free will to the cards. \'93In the comparable tables I\'92ll create for the complete point count system, I\'92ll put the values of the high-low index to guide the standing decision in the cells where the decision isn\'92t clear-cut and obvious, that is, where the value would not be either a very large positive or negative number. If the player\'92s high-low index exceeds the value in the cell, he holds. If it\'92s lower than the value in the cell, he takes a card.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This is very clever, Ed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I thank you. It\'92s a very concise summary of your type of work. If that means clever, so be it. The ten-count strategy is also powerful, but the ratio of non-tens to tens is always a small decimal fraction, and memorizing and recalling them can produce migraines.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Harvey Dubner presented his results more or less verbally,\'94 continued Oakley. \'93I think presenting them in this tabular form will be easier for the player to use.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He turned over the top sheet to reveal a second. He let Julian stare at it for a moment. \'93This is a similarly laid out table for hard doubling, and here\'92s the table for soft doubling. And,\'94 he said, turning to a fourth page, \'93here\'92s the basic strategy table for splitting. In each case the format is the same, the dealer\'92s up-card along the top row and the relevant player\'92s cards along the left column. That\'92s the two-card total for hard doubling, combination of Ace and another card for soft doubling, and the various pairs for the pair splitting table. Values of the high-low index determining the decision will appear in these cells. The table for soft drawing and standing is much simpler, with just a couple decisions not clear-cut.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think you\'92ll find that most of the strategy decisions will be the same as in the less sophisticated systems, Baldwin\'92s, your basic strategy, and your five- count strategy,\'94 said Julian with the experience of one who had performed the most extensive programming of the game. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s the marginal, difficult decisions that will be decided, based on your results, by the complete point count system,\'94 said Oakley, almost bragging, although a large portion of the credit was due, as he knew, to Julian. \'93Yeah,\'94 said Julian pointing to an entry in Oakley\'92s table for holding and drawing. \'93Here, for example, if you\'92ve got a total of 12 against the dealer\'92s 6, or a 13 against her 2.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Or double down with a 9 against her 3, or an 11 against her Ace,\'94 said Oakley referring to his second page. \'93The basic strategy says double down holding an 11 and, depending on the dealer\'92s up-card, usually a 10 and some- times a 9. The index will uncover other favorable situations.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This is a much more powerful system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. These are difficult decisions for the player.\'94 Oakley showed Julian the fourth page again. \'93Here, the splitting table for the basic strategy says to split fours against a five. I\'92m sure the complete point count will provide guides to split against her 4 and 6, too. It\'92ll provide guides for standing or drawing, doubling down, and splitting that a player using the basic strategy would never consider.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Even splitting tens, perhaps,\'94 suggested Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The basic strategy says never split tens,\'94 noted Oakley. \'93But with a high value of the index, indicating many tens and Aces remain in the deck, that might be a good move. The ten-count strategy uncovered such cases.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But you never tried it out in the casinos,\'94 remarked Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nope. I never tried it out in the casinos,\'94 said Oakley. \'93But that\'92s going to change.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93From your mouth to God\'92s ears,\'94 said Julian, repeating one of his mother\'92s favorite phrases. \'93But you\'92re right, winning these marginal cases should mark- edly increase the player\'92s advantage,\'94 Julian summarized. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The super-sensitive sense of the humor of the brilliant mind was manifested as Oakley laughed at what 99.999% of the population would consider an extremely dry, humorless statement. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That is the real advantage of the complete point count system,\'94 chuckled Oakley. \'93With the 704, I found an overall player\'92s advantage of 0.12% play- ing my recalculated basic strategy, and up to a 3.6% advantage playing the five-count, when all the fives have been played. I recalculated Baldwin\'92s strat- egy and found a 0.09% advantage to the player. Using your results, I wouldn\'92t be surprised to find advantages of 5 to 10% or more using the complete point count system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Or 15% or 20%,\'94 laughed Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hey, you want to get some tea or coffee?\'94 asked Oakley. They both needed a break.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Sure.\'94 They walked out of Oakley\'92s office down the hall to the faculty lounge. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If this works, Julian \'96\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93The 7044 hasn\'92t lied to me yet. Oh, it\'92ll work.\'94\u8232 \'93When this works, Julian, we\'92re going to publish it.\'94\u8232 \'93Yeah.\'94\u8232 \'93Maybe, maybe not in the probability journals. Maybe in a book.\'94\u8232 \'93Wow.

\fs32 board and use more complicated point value assignments. But it won\'92t mark- edly increase the actual casino performance.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Braun and Oakley,\'94 Oakley wrote in the sky. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, you started it at the AMS meeting. It\'92ll be Oakley and Braun. And we should really include Dubner.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Have you tested your results?\'94 asked Oakley. It had only been a few weeks since the American Mathematical Society meeting, and Oakley remained sen- sitive to the criticism of the skeptics, the press, some mathematicians, and the public. He knew that Julian, having been in attendance, would be aware of this need. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I let the computer deal nine billion hands,\'94 answered Julian. He could tell from Oakley\'92s lowering his head that the answer wasn\'92t sufficient. \'93And I\'92ve dealt myself some decks.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Having arrived in the lounge, Oakley poured hot water into a cup. \'93Coffee or tea, Julian?\'94 He pointed to a group of tea boxes. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Green tea looks good,\'94 said Julian, pouring hot water into a cup for him- self and pulling out a tea bag from one of the boxes. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, I mean, at the casinos?\'94 Oakley knew Julian was dodging the ques- tion. He knew the situation as well as Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I was at the meeting, too,\'94 said Julian, admitting the obvious. \'93They\'92re brutalizing you. But I really don\'92t gamble. It\'92s . . . I don\'92t like it, the atmo- sphere. The fear of losing my modest life\'92s savings.\'94 He hoped that Oakley would accept his excuses. They sat down at a table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Look. Manny Kimmel is coming up from New York in two weeks. He\'92s having dinner at the house. I think he wants me to teach him the ten-count strategy. Hopefully we\'92ll have finished the analysis of the complete point count by then. I\'92d like you to be there. Help me feel him out. If he can learn it and win in the casinos, it\'92ll silence the skeptics for good. Can you come back?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You chose Manny Kimmel?\'94 said Julian, relieved that he would not be chosen Vice-President of Casino Testing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Consider it a final interview,\'94 said Oakley. \'93They all have money. But he\'92s a multimillionaire, and I wanted to involve someone who wouldn\'92t be hurt if they lost their entire bankroll. He\'92s also a big blackjack player, so I think he\'92s sold in advance on our system and won\'92t give us trouble if things go bad. Some of the others had similar traits, but I think he\'92s pretty savvy when it comes to spotting cheating dealers. That\'92s really our only obstacle.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Cheating,\'94 said a happy Julian. \'93That\'92s the one thing I can\'92t code.\'94 He finally could crack a joke, although it seemed to be his only joke, being similar to the one he made with Nancy about coding stupid moves at chess. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What? You can\'92t?\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They both laughed. No matter how much faith they had in their math- ematics, both, particularly Oakley, wanted the system tested in the casino. He needed to silence his detractors and he needed to dispel his own doubts, no matter how irrational they were.

Even with all the Irish alcoholics lying in the streets, it was always a great place to go to college. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The tens of thousands of professors, staff, and students, though, have a demand for housing, and, although many students live in the dorms or frater- nities during their freshman and perhaps sophomore years, by their upperclass years many look for apartments or houses to rent. For a newly arrived faculty member, especially if married, finding congenial, affordable, and relatively nearby housing can be challenging. College and university housing offices can help find nearby apartments, but for Vivian and Oakley, the options were not acceptable. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They were able, however, to find a nice, small rental house in Brookline, a western suburb of Boston just across the Charles River and a bit west from Cambridge and MIT. It was a quick ride on the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the MTA of the George O\'92Brien themed celebrated song by the Kingston Trio, to the Massachusetts Avenue stop and then either a bus ride or a hitchhike across the river. If Oakley had been a bike rider, he could have made the trip on Beacon Street, past Fenway Park, and across the Harvard Bridge on Massachusetts Avenue directly into campus in 15 minutes. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Hitchhiking across the Harvard Bridge was not fraught with the usual hitchhiking anxiety of not succeeding and, in this case, missing classes. The scads of students standing there, thirty at a time, thumbs in the air, posed no

\fs24 \

\fs32 The house the Thorps had rented had an enclosed garage, where Oakley felt his T-Bird would be safe not only from youthful vandalism but also from the weather, his having been warned about the ferocity of nor\'92easters. One dent was enough. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Their oval dining room table was covered with white linen this special eve- ning. Coffee cups and saucers, a bowl of fruit, a box of chocolates, a vase of flowers, linen napkins, and spoons lay on the table, around which seven chairs sat. A breakfront cabinet, bought from a used furniture store, judging from the fine scratches on its cabinet doors, stood against the wall. Almost all of the furnishings in their home were rented or bought used. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The little party to both entertain and interrogate Manny Kimmel was jovial enough. Oakley, as the host, sat in the chair at one end of the table. Julian and Nancy sat to his left. When Julian had driven up in his rented car with Nancy, Oakley and Vivian had been a bit surprised. They had no idea that Julian, he the bookish type, had a girlfriend, and they certainly hadn\'92t been forewarned that she was coming along. That crisis was minor, Oakley and Vivian quickly discovering that Nancy was an educated, respectable woman, and, more importantly, that Julian and Nancy hadn\'92t planned on making the Oakley home their hotel. It had gotten warm enough in Massachusetts, with the temperatures predicted to be in the high 40s, that Nancy and Julian had planned a trip to Cape Cod. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny Kimmel and the women he introduced as his nieces, Madeleine and Renee, sat to Oakley\'92s right. His entry was, shall we say, a bit more osten- tatious than that of Julian and Nancy. Driving up in a large, midnight blue Cadillac is one thing. The car door opening for the exit of two ravishing, voluptuous blonde women in their 20s who were wearing chartreuse stiletto heels and revealing dresses under their mink coats was another. It\'92s a good thing that the driveway up to the Oakley\'92s house was partially shielded by the house itself. Residents of this area of Brookline weren\'92t accustomed to seeing a large Cadillac spouting out two sirens, nieces or not. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny Kimmel was in his sixties, white-haired and small of stature. Sitting between his nieces in the car, he had been hidden from view. A prominent diamond ring weighed down one of his fingers. The 
\f2\i de rigueur 
\f1\i0 gold chains draped his neck. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Dinner had been served and Nancy had helped Vivian clear the table, a service that was much appreciated. Vivian stood behind Madeleine ready to serve, holding a coffee pot and a tea pot as Julian and Nancy sipped from 
\fs24 \

\fs32 their cups. Oakley sampled a piece of cantaloupe from the fruit dish. Most of the pieces of fruit in the fruit bowl and most of the pieces of boxed chocolate would be consumed during and after coffee and tea. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thank you, Vivian,\'94 said Nancy.\uc0\u8232 \'93Coffee or tea, Madeleine?\'94 asked the hostess.\u8232 \'93Could I have a little apricot brandy, please?\'94 asked Madeleine.\u8232 \'93My niece, see, she likes fruit,\'94 explained Manny.\u8232 \'93Lots of vitamins,\'94 Madeleine added.\u8232 Vivian put the coffee pot and tea pot down on the table and walked over to 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the breakfront cabinet. She pulled out a liquor bottle. \'93Well, special treats for special guests,\'94 she said. Manny gestured toward Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93You\'92re a lucky man
\f0\b , 
\f1\b0 Thorp,\'94 he said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s no such thing as luck,\'94 Julian corrected him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, doctor,\'94 said Manny. \'93That\'92s where we differ. There is luck. And with me bankrolling your little experiment, I expect a lot of luck.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He turned to Nancy.\uc0\u8232 \'93You believe in luck, Nancy? You know, fate?\'94\u8232 Vivian returned to the table with the liquor bottle and a schnapps glass. \'93We didn\'92t have apricot brandy,\'94 she apologized to Madeleine. \'93Is peach 
\fs24 \

\fs32 brandy okay?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Sure,\'94 Madeleine giggled.\u8232 Vivian poured a little of the brandy into the schnapps glass. Madeleine 
\fs24 \

\fs32 watched her pour.\uc0\u8232 \'93A double, please,\'94 she said.\u8232 \'93I think Mr. Braun would agree that probability is important,\'94 Oakley 
\fs24 \

\fs32 replied to Manny. \'93But luck in the sense of an external force of some sort is not realistic. It has no place in rational inquiry.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 This was not the kind of discussion to which Madeleine or Renee was accustomed. Madeleine was closely monitoring the level of booze in her glass as Vivian added what she was guessing would be equivalent to a second shot. Renee rolled her eyes in disbelief at the conversation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian, finished with Madeleine\'92s glass, walked over to Renee with the cof- fee and tea pots. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Gad,\'94 Renee said, turning her attention from the conversation to the liq- uid offering. \'93You got a Pabst or a Bud?\'94 she asked before Vivian could offer the coffee or tea. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93She ain\'92t no health freak like her cousin,\'94 said Manny. \'93No sweet tooth, either.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think so,\'94 answered Vivian, leaving the room for the kitchen.

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, every once in a while, Mr. Kimmel.\'94 He stared at the kitchen. This wasn\'92t the kind of treatment he had expected for his wife. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What other kinds of ways can they cheat you?\'94 Julian asked.\uc0\u8232 Vivian returned with a bottle and a glass.\u8232 \'93Here\'92s a cold Bud and a glass, Renee,\'94 she said, delivering the goods. \'93Oh, goody,\'94 responded the non-health freak. Manny\'92s supposed niece 
\fs24 \

\fs32 couldn\'92t wait, and guzzled the Bud from the can. This didn\'92t bother Manny, having no doubt seen it before. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Coffee for me,\'94 he said to Vivian. \'93No sugar.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian picked up the coffee pot from the table and poured some coffee into Manny\'92s cup. She sat down, audibly, as if letting gravity do its thing unhin- dered. She was sending a message to Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dealing the second card,\'94 Manny answered Julian\'92s question. \'93They peek, see, sometimes using the reflection in a pinky ring. If they don\'92t want the card for you or themselves they deal the second. So, you check their fingers. Pinky ring? You run.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Marked cards?\'94 asked Oakley. This was a business meeting, and although he was aware of Vivian\'92s playing the unintended barmaid, they had to see if Manny possessed the casino street knowledge that he claimed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No,\'94 said Manny, \'93they don\'92t do that no more. People who say that are full of hot air. The decks are clean. See, the regulators, they\'92re all over the house. The decks, they unseal them at the table and spread \'91em out.\'94 He made a sweeping motion with his hand, simulating this activity. \'93You can examine them. But they do mark \'91em during the play. They fold back the edge a little, see? Undetectable.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93False shuffle?\'94 asked Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. That\'92s a real problem,\'94 answered Manny. \'93The good ones, the mechanics, they shuffle and keep the order.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mrs. Thorp,\'94 Renee called. \'93You got another Bud? That hit the spot.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian had been sitting for barely two minutes. Under the table she had slipped her feet out of her flats for relief. She stared at Oakley before jovially answering. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure,\'94 she said. \'93Coming up.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian rose out of her seat and walked into the kitchen. Oakley took a piece of fruit. He was trying to show everyone that everything was okay with Vivian, to the extent that his stomach wasn\'92t churning in empathy the way it in fact was. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mechanics?\'94 asked Julian, unfamiliar with the term. \'93Card sharks,\'94 Oakley answered. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right,\'94 agreed Manny. \'93They\'92re called mechanics. See, they\'92re professional cheaters. On call from a bunch of houses.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian returned with a second can of Bud. As she placed it in front of Renee, Madeleine took a piece of chocolate from the box of chocolates and bit into it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ewwww!\'94 exclaimed Madeleine. She turned her nose inside out and swung her head to the right, apparently in some kind of survival mode, then placed the uneaten half of the piece of chocolate back into the box of chocolates. In response to this display, Julian and Nancy looked at each other in disbelief and Vivian stared at Madeleine. Vivian sat down, although she wouldn\'92t have been blamed if she had simply fainted. Julian and Nancy were now quite sure that Madeleine had not been raised in a household conforming to upper-crust British etiquette. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oy,\'94 said Nancy under her breath. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You can always tell \'91em, the mechanics,\'94 Manny continued, oblivious to the candy game and body language. \'93They come in any time, not just the shift breaks. And they don\'92t wear the house uniform.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Madeleine licked her lips. Vivian had been sitting down now for nearly thirty seconds. \'93Mrs. Thorp, you got a Snickers bar maybe? Or some M and M\'92s?\'94 Fine chocolates weren\'92t her style, it seems. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian got up and walked to the kitchen. This time she walked slowly. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That reminds me,\'94 said Manny. \'93The uniform. You gotta hide you doing this system stuff. Be a regular bullshit artist. Pretend you\'92re ski bunnies or something, you know, there for skiing. Wear a parka. You know, fit in. Or booze hounds. For the free drinks. Slobber it on you, so you reek of the stuff.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Vivian and I are musicians,\'94 Oakley said. He wanted to make sure to include his wife, and spoke the words loudly enough so she, still scrounging for some chocolate in the kitchen, could hear it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, that\'92s good,\'94 responded Manny. \'93You came to hear the music or something.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, how do you protect yourself against the false shuffle?\'94 persevered Julian. He was aware of the impending nuptial crisis, but he hadn\'92t driven in from Chicago to watch a parade of beer and chocolates. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, sorry, a problem. But it\'92s hard to keep the meld if you shuffle more than twice. And you gotta be sure, see, that they cut the deck first, shuffle each part, and then put the deck together and shuffle again. That pretty much wipes out the melds unless the guy\'92s really good.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley looked toward the kitchen. Either Vivian was sitting somewhere taking a break or was digging very deeply in drawers looking for those Snickers or M and M\'92s.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Bottom dealing?\'94 he asked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No,\'94 answered Manny. \'93See, they burn a card but flip it first. So, see, the bottom card is turned over. Too obvious, anyway. Guy turns his palm, looks at the bottom card. Nah. That don\'92t happen no more. You\'92re not going to have to worry about that when you\'92re playing. You and the wife are musicians. That\'92s a good cover.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What do you mean?\'94 asked Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You don\'92t have to worry about that,\'94 repeated Manny. \'93They ain\'92t inter- ested in cheating kid musicians. Pretend you\'92re there to get a gig.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What? I\'92m not gambling,\'94 stated Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure you are. I\'92m providing the cash. A hundred big ones. You\'92re gambling and doubling it. That\'92s it.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I thought you wanted me to teach you the system. Look, I\'92ve got to prove to all these doubters that the system works, but you\'92ve got to play.\'94 Oakley was starting to get an empty feeling in his stomach. \'93And I\'92m uncomfortable with such sums,\'94 he added. \'93Ten thousand is enough.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No no no no no no no,\'94 said Manny in a near stammer. \'93They know who I am. And I can\'92t do your math stuff. My nephew Seymour, he\'92s a math genius, too. He could do it, but not me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He stared at Oakley. \'93You\'92re going to do this. Me and some of my best friends, we provide the cash and take 90% of the profit. It\'92s a business deal. Ten thousand? That\'92s okay. You\'92re doubling it. We make the profit, and you try out your system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny Kimmel, born Emmanuel Kimmel, was a bookie and gangster in New Jersey and New York dating from the Depression. Unknown to Oakley, he had been considered a \'93notable underworld figure\'94 for decades. He was considered to have run the largest handle horseracing book in a crime- ridden, book-happy, corrupt New York City. He worked with the single big- gest racketeer and bootlegger in Newark, Abner \'93Longy\'94 Zwillman, a feared Prohibition gangster, leasing his garages to Zwillman for storage of liquor dur- ing Prohibition. So well-known were his transgressions that the FBI tracked him for his relationships with the mob and eventually persuaded him to tes- tify against Zwillman, his former associate. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He and his wife Pauline (Polk) had founded the Kinney Parking Company, a prominent national chain of parking lots and garages. The name was sug- gested by its first location having been on Kinney Street in Newark. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 That Manny had adopted this name to hide his Jewish identity was the 
\f2\i modus operandi 
\f1\i0 of American Jews from the turn of the twentieth century to its end, a \'93time-honored tradition\'94 of American Jews anglicizing both their given and business names to hide their Jewish identity. This was done not only to 
\fs24 \

\fs32 avoid anti-Semitic persecution and discrimination but also to fulfill a desire to be accepted and assimilated into American society. Although they still read newspapers published in the Yiddish of Eastern Europe, supporting dozens across the country, the pride of first generation-born American Jews was to learn and become fluent in English. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Yet, they still faced persecution and discrimination. Most professions were to some degree closed to Jews, including architecture, medicine, law, and vet- erinary practice. The famous Cornell University veterinary school, for exam- ple, through the early 1940s, allowed only one Jew in an entering class. Jewish animal lovers reacted by founding a veterinary school at what was to become Middlesex University in Waltham, Massachusetts, with a faculty of Jews who had fled Germany. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Colleges and universities, including most of the elite universities, even until the 1980s, had such Jewish \'93quotas,\'94 severely restricting the number of Jewish students they would admit, previous academic success and future academic promise being irrelevant. With programs in medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, and veterinary medicine, as well as the liberal arts, Middlesex was the only university in the United States at which the medical and vet- erinary schools did not impose a quota on Jews. The American Medical Association refused to grant accreditation to its med school, which its non- Jewish founder partially attributed to institutional anti-Semitism. After the founder\'92s death, Middlesex evolved into the predominantly Jewish Brandeis University in 1947. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Socially, Jews were isolated. The Jews who entered college would form their own fraternities and sororities, the Sigma Chi\'92s and Tri Delt\'92s not rushing Jews for members. Out of college, with admission to social and athletic Clubs denied, the Jews formed their own. Julian Braun\'92s parents belonged to the Covenant Club, formed by Eastern European Jews. Chicago Jews of German descent formed and joined the Standard Club. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 One of the few fields open to Jews was physics, that not being a calling of most non-Jews. With the field open, most of the breathtaking develop- ments of the 20th century were made by Jews. The names of Jews, Hans Bethe, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, Richard Feynman, Albert Michelson, Max Born, James Franck, Emilio Segre, Arno Penzias, Murray Gell-Mann, Leon Lederman, Niels Bohr, Steven Weinberg, and others, are inscribed in the listings of Nobel Prize winners in gross disproportionality to their numbers. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the genius who directed in the Manhattan Project, which contained the greatest assemblage of physics intellects ever assem- bled, was Jewish. This success aside, Jews were denied entry into most other American professions.

\fs32 \cf3 Jews, indeed, created their own American industries where they would not suffer discrimination in opportunity and hiring. Three of the five American- born entertainment industries were of Jewish origin. New York City Jewish veterans of vaudeville performed in the resorts of the Catskill Mountains, and there, in the Borscht Belt, stand-up comedy was born. Those with a musi- cal and theatrical bent founded musical theatre, an outgrowth of Eastern European Yiddish Theatre and the source of the popular music canon known as the \'93great American songbook.\'94 The motion picture industry was founded by Jews who moved to southern California. Of the five American-born enter- tainment industries, only vaudeville and jazz, created in New Orleans by blacks, were not of Jewish origin. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 That discrimination in the professions and colleges continued after World War II. The 500,000 American Jews, an absolutely remarkable half of all Jewish males between the ages of 18 and 50, who served, fought, and became injured or died in the war returned to a bigoted America. Many, facing this discouraging fact, opted to devote themselves to the creation of a Jewish homeland. Israel was built on the intellect and industry of transplanted Jews. In a significant way, American bigotry led to its creation, existence, and flour- ishing as a prominent world center in agriculture, military technology, and salt water reclamation, and as well as classical music and the graphic arts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 To avoid discrimination as well as to seek assimilation, American Jews changed their last names. Cohen became Kahn and Cahn. Greenbaum became Greene. Goldstein became Golden. Shapiro became Shepard. Entertainers could be partially excused for the sake of the marquee, Cyd Charisse adopt- ing that name from her given Tula Finklea, Tony Curtis having been born Bernard Schwartz, Kirk Douglas having been born Issur Danielovitch, and Jack Benny having been born Benny Kubelsky, but it didn\'92t hurt bookings if they had what they referred to as \'93goyish,\'94 that is, gentile, sounding names. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Learning the lesson, Jewish parents would forego the traditional old- country Jewish first names. They would try to avoid the Irving\'92s, Abe\'92s, Sam\'92s, Ben\'92s, Nathan\'92s, Max\'92s, Bernard\'92s, Myron\'92s, Meyer\'92s, Hymen\'92s, Saul\'92s, Bertha\'92s, Tillie\'92s, Libby\'92s, and Rose\'92s of their fathers and mothers and name their children Elyse, Iris, Renee, Brad, and Todd. Because Jews name their children after the Jewish name of deceased loved ones, this necessitated some imaginative phonemic manipulation. Parents would choose an English name of \'93Larry\'94 or \'93Leslie\'94 to honor and memorialize \'93Eliezer.\'94 Similarly, \'93Moshe\'94 would be remembered as \'93Morris\'94 or \'93Mark,\'94 \'93Chanah\'94 as \'93Anne,\'94 \'93Miriam\'94 as \'93Marla,\'94 \'93Binyomin\'94 as \'93Bruce,\'94 and \'93Pinchus\'94 as \'93Paul.\'94 Emmanuel Kimmel preferred to be called Manny. As I said, he named his business \'93Kinney,\'94 an Irish surname. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In the case of our family, both Vivian\'92s father, Abe Sinetar, a businessman, and her mother, Adele Steiner, were Jewish. Because Jews ascribe the religion of the mother to the children, that connection being documentable, all of us Thorp kids are Jewish, and we were raised Jewish. My maternal grandpar- ents\'92 names \'93sound\'94 Jewish, but \'93Vivian\'94 was a good old American-sounding name. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Whether or not his associates knew his ethnic background, Manny\'92s suc- cessful resume included being a bookie in his younger days and running the numbers game and other books in New Jersey. He was knowledgeable, con- nected, and passionate about his \'93career.\'94 This passion even led him to own several racehorses. By the time he met Oakley he had never served a day of time, and he never would. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley paused, thunderstruck, to borrow Robinson Crusoe\'92s description at seeing Friday\'92s footprints in the sand, at this unexpected diatribe from what he was hoping would be his bankrolling bookie buddy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s me trying it or nothing, huh?\'94 he asked Manny. He turned to Julian. \'93Spring break, Julian?\'94\uc0\u8232 Julian nodded his head affirmatively, then checked in with Nancy. \'93Nancy?\'94 Vivian chose this moment to return with a candy bar. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The Three Musketeers,\'94 Nancy said, referring either to the candy bar or to the trio of Oakley, Julian, and Manny. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I can\'92t gamble,\'94 Oakley reconsidered.\uc0\u8232 \'93You never played blackjack?\'94 said an incredulous Manny.\u8232 \'93In grad school, we went up to Tahoe once, but not with these kind of 
\fs24 \

\fs32 stakes.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93What\'92s the diff?\'94 said Manny. \'93It\'92s the same game. You want to try out 
\fs24 \

\fs32 your system, then we give you the cash and you do the playing.\'94 He stared at Oakley, who, by his pursed eyebrows, showed he wasn\'92t convinced. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hey, Thorp,\'94 yelled Manny. He slammed his fist on the table, causing the coffee and tea cups and their saucers to jiggle. \'93You want to prove it works, then you play,\'94 his voice was suddenly raspy, showing that years of screaming had taken its toll on his vocal cords. \'93I didn\'92t come up here to take no crap.\'94

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93On the contrary, I thought he was very well-mannered and I thought they were delightful girls,\'94 said Vivian. Oakley had been apologizing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, I thought . . .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nice girls. Polite,\'94 recalled Vivian. \'93\'91Double, please.\'92 I wonder what side of the family they\'92re on. His mother\'92s or his father\'92s.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well . . .,\'94 said Oakley. He knew Vivian was playing with him, and he was just waiting for his first New England nor\'92easter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Very nice. That was very nice.\'94 She inhaled deeply, to be able to maximize the volume and velocity of the cyclone. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I am not a cocktail waitress for street-walkers!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Vivian . . .,\'94 said Oakley, not quite yet in begging mode. He was grateful that the cups and saucers had been safely placed in the cabinet. He was certain that they would have been swept up and carried off to Auntie Em\'92s farm in Kansas. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian reached into the box of chocolates and pulled out Madeleine\'92s half- eaten piece. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here, you want a piece of chocolate? It\'92s already been taste-tested.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ll admit that . . .\'94 Vivian wasn\'92t ready for excuses. Making up was still miles away. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Will the real Edward Thorp please stand up?\'94 she said. \'93Is it Edward Thorp number one, Edward Thorp number two, or Edward Thorp number three? The jazz trumpet player and mathematics professor? Or the gambler who consorts with prostitutes and gangsters?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What\'92s number three?\'94 Oakley asked. He hoped, with only a small prob- ability of success, that a smart-aleck joke could dissipate the storm. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re not going to charm me, Edward Thorp,\'94 she said, rejecting the attempt. \'93Do you know the secret of being charming? It\'92s to make others think they\'92re charming. You\'92re not doing a very good job right now.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s a business deal,\'94 Oakley explained. \'93At school you have to consort with the government to get grants to support your research. Here, it\'92s a different sort of funding.\'94 Maybe reason would help. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Funding? Funding? I have to bring these kinds of women into my home and be their cocktail waitress to get funding?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s just a temporary association. He\'92s our road to fortune, Vivian. He\'92s got street smarts, and money. This is not about money, but we get 10%. and if I double his money our $1,000 is nearly two months of my salary.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ten percent? My father should teach you something about business.\'94 \'93And look, Vivian, he was, uh, persuasive.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I thought I knew you. I was searching for someone like you, searching like a river that can\'92t find the sea, and I thought I found you, but now . . . Why do you have to do this anyway?\'94 Vivian had thrown in a lyric from \'93Gingi.\'94 Perhaps her anger had short-circuited her mind and she had run out of words of her own. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The computer simulations you and Julian did. They show your system works. Isn\'92t that enough?\'94 she begged. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s not enough. I\'92ve got to prove to these skeptics that I\'92m not just in an ivory tower, damn it,\'94 Oakley said. He had given up trying to appease Vivian. The storm now burst from deep within him. \'93They were mocking me at the meeting. My father, I love my father, but he always would say pure math is for people who walk on clouds. He worked as a bank guard, and the fam- ily moved to L.A. so that he and my mother could work in a defense plant. He believed fervently in the power of education, but he didn\'92t want me to struggle financially. He would introduce me to his friends, \'91This is my son, Edward. He wants to be like the King of Laputa. He thinks he can make a living walking on clouds.\'92 They\'92d look at me just like they did at the math conference and laugh and mock me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, Edward.\'94 She had never heard this chapter of the Thorp family his- tory before. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley turned his back to Vivian, stared out the kitchen window, and then turned back to her. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And there\'92s another thing. I\'92m a scholar. Most of us aren\'92t very pretty. We don\'92t have constantly beaming smiles or great personalities. We\'92ve got brains. Our product is the product of our brains. I mean look at me. I wasn\'92t the most athletic or handsome or toughest kid in the neighborhood growing up in Chicago and I\'92m not now.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think you\'92re very . . .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I skipped grades and found myself in classes with older, bigger kids. To sur- vive in the neighborhood I had to be a wise guy, use my brains. Later I fell in love with numbers and I was good at it. I\'92m still good at it. They\'92re my life, and I\'92m proud of my work and no one, not the reporters, not my father, not the edi- torial writer at the 
\f2\i Washington Post
\f1\i0 , no one is going to mock me and my work, especially when I know it\'92s right. You remember what that pit boss at Barney\'92s said? \'91When a lamb goes to the slaughter, the lamb might kill the butcher. But we always bet on the butcher.\'92 Well, I have to prove that he\'92s wrong. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This work on probability is like a capsule of the great scientific projects. It may rank with that of Cardano, Pascal, Laplace, and Poisson, and their works live on forever. I\'92m not going to be denied that chance. And, even if it doesn\'92t gain that stature, no one is going to deny me the thrill that comes

\fs24 \

\fs32 He paused and reflected. \'93This isn\'92t exactly the image my father had for me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, Edward. I didn\'92t know. But he loves you.\'94 Vivian was feeling the kind of grief you can only feel when you\'92ve inadvertently hurt someone you love. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, maybe. But it\'92s true what he said. Mathematicians prove lemmas, conjectures, theorems. You know how you get a Ph. D in math? You do a proof,\'94 Oakley said. Now he was mocking himself, thought Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Pages and pages of lemmas and derivations. That\'92s it. No real use. I have to do a different sort of proof, Vivian. First, I\'92m going to shut those people up. Then, I have to prove to everyone, including myself, that I can do more than walk on clouds.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Vivian must have said \'93okay.\'94\uc0\u8232 Manny had secured lodging for all of them, Vivian and Oakley, Allan and 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joan, Julian and Nancy, as well as an enormous luxury suite for himself and his nieces, at the most prestigious gambling location in Reno, the Mapes Hotel. The first high-rise hotel/casino complex in the entire state of Nevada, located on the northeast corner of Virginia Street and the Truckee River, it was the destina- tion of both celebrity visitors and performing acts booked in the top floor The Sky Room. Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Sammy Davis, Jr., and many others had either stayed or performed there, hanging out during leisure hours at the ground floor Lamplighter Bar. Vivian and Oakley\'92s act would never have been booked at the Mapes Hotel. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was just as well. To keep business and pleasure separate, Manny and Oakley agreed that they should not stay where they would gamble. They would gamble at Harold\'92s Club. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The sign above the stage proclaimed the name of its more modest entertain- ment venue to be the \'93Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge.\'94 Below that was a smaller sign reminding the potentially inebriated patron that the lounge was in Harold\'92s Club. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Several cocktail tables sat in front of the stage, and more filled the rest of the 80-person occupancy lounge. A modest-sized dance floor faced the right side of the stage as viewed from the audience. The stage footlights were turned off, but the house lights were on, providing sufficient lighting for the visitors. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Julian and Nancy sat at one cocktail table next to the stage. They had been a couple for almost 6 years and, although Julian was now 31 years old, marriage was not an issue, as much as their parents would have 
\f2\i kvelled 
\f1\i0 over it. Traveling to Reno together was only a quantum commitment greater than traveling

\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan, Joan, and the lounge manager, Bernie Kurtzman, in his 60s, sat at a third table in front of the stage. Two other chairs were at the table, aban- doned by Vivian and Oakley for their trip to the stage. Chairs were sitting, upside-down, on the other, unoccupied cocktail tables. Allan wore a coat and tie. The tie was sloppily knotted, a giveaway that coat and tie were not Allan\'92s habitual attire. Allan had finished his post-doc at UCLA, and he and Joan had returned to Berkeley, where he had obtained a teaching position. Academic life did not require a coat and tie. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If you challenged the speed limit, it was a short 31\uc0\u8260 4 hour drive from Berkeley to Reno through Donner Pass, that of the ill-fated Donner party pio- neers, and over the Sierra Nevada. This was a scenic California trip. Highway 80 passes through Sacramento to the Donner area and, having negotiated Donner Pass, a ride over the highest point along Highway 80 of the Sierras whose treacherously steep descent to the east requires tire chains and cau- tiously low speeds during the winter, you drive a few more miles along the north shore of Donner Lake into Truckee and then follow a serpentine path through the Truckee River mini-valley into Reno. You frequently drive next to the river itself, crossing it back and forth no less than eight exhilarating times before reaching the gambling mecca. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Actually, to tell the truth, the historical Donner Pass lies about a mile south of Highway 80, but everyone refers to the route as going through Donner Pass anyway. It makes it sound like you\'92re more of a brave old West pioneer and you gain the sympathy of those who have had to install chains. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan had learned well that after a winter storm, the residents set up shop at the top of the pass selling chains and chain-installation services. You have to decide whether to spend the $10 for installation alone or freeze your hands putting on chains yourself. The residents of the Donner area must either be proud of its name or aware that it may attract historically literate tourists who may or may not be considering cannibalism. It contains a Donner Avenue, Donner Lake Road, Donner Pass Road, Donner Creek, Donner Lake, and Donner Memorial State Park, in addition to numerous cafes and other busi- nesses with the name. The traveler obtains some designation relief reaching Truckee a few miles to the east. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan and Joan watched as Vivian, Oakley, and a jazz trio composed of a pianist, bassist, and drummer stood or sat on the stage, as befitted their instru- ments. They were about to begin performing, without microphones. Bernie alternated looking at the stage and at a photograph and resume of the jazz duo. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian spoke the first line of \'93On a Slow Boat to China,\'94 a nice artistic effect, and then sang as Oakley accompanied her with jazz licks on his trumpet. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93All I know is,\'94 she said.\uc0\u8232 The trio began to play as Vivian started to sing.

\fs32 \cf3 Vivian walked over to the piano as Oakley began to play a jazz chorus on his trumpet. The trio was happily playing behind them. They had realized that this wasn\'92t the usual Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge type of offering. As Oakley came to the final bars of his solo, Vivian walked back to the center of the stage. She continued the song,

\fs32 \cf3 It\'92s a great tune, and Vivian and Oakley performed it professionally. The house trio looked at each other, smiling. This was a duo with whom they\'92d like to, as they say, go on the road. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny and his nieces, Allan and Joan, Julian and Nancy, and Bernie applauded. Allan put his forefinger and middle finger into his mouth and whistled quite loudly, especially for a mathematician. It really didn\'92t have to be so loud in the nearly empty Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge, thought Nancy. Vivian and Oakley smiled, turned around to thank the members of the trio, then walked over to Bernie\'92s table and sat down. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Bernie had liked the music. \'93Play a little more, guys,\'94 he said to the trio. They had been called in for the purposes of the audition, and, if Bernie had not been the guy who would hire them, they probably would have demurred. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The trio, in good judgment, allowed themselves to be manipulated, as most artists must, and played a ballad. They were feeling jazzy themselves, and chose an up-tempo \'93Blue Moon,\'94 with the drummer displaying acumen on the brushes.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Can I have a dance with the prettiest girl at the prom?\'94 said Allan to Joan. \'93Shucks. Sure, cowboy,\'94 she replied.\uc0\u8232 They stood up and walked to the dance floor and started to dance. Manny, too, felt the groove. Showing ultimate 
\f2\i chutzpah
\f1\i0 , he turned to Nancy. \'93I ain\'92t much of a dancer, but it would be a great honor if you\'92d join me on 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the floor.\'94 Nancy thought it was probably inappropriate to dance with your nieces unless it\'92s a wedding. Nonetheless, she looked at Julian for approval. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Go ahead,\'94 he said. \'93I\'92m not a dancer at all.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s easy, Julian. You just move your arms and legs with a complete lack of coherence.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nah,\'94 he said. \'93Just enjoy yourself.\'94\uc0\u8232 Nancy and Manny walked over to the dance floor and started to dance. \'93First, let me tell ya\'92,\'94 Bernie said to Vivian and Oakley. \'93I\'92m very impressed 
\fs24 \

\fs32 with both of ya\'92. Very talented kids. Can I ask you a question?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Sure,\'94 said Oakley.\u8232 \'93You know,\'94 he began, \'93you gotta be twenty-one to play this lounge. Do 
\fs24 \

\fs32 you know that? Same thing with all the lounges in Reno. You kids look like teenagers, college students.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We\'92re just out of college,\'94 Vivian answered, telling a half fib about Oakley\'92s credentials. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley waved to Allan and Joan to come over and join them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Our manager should be in on this,\'94 he explained to Bernie. Indeed, Bernie Kurtzman had thought it was strange that the manager of the act had not been sitting at the table immediately after \'93On a Slow Boat to China\'94 had ended. For their part, Vivian, Oakley, and Allan hadn\'92t spent a lot of time rehearsing for the audition showdown in the Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley gave Allan a half glare as he and Joan walked over and sat down at the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 said Bernie, unaware of the drama. \'93See, that\'92s the problem.\'94 He directed himself to the duo\'92s manager. \'93These kids are just out of college. The people who come into this lounge here are in their fifties, sixties, seventies.\'94 He pointed over to Manny. \'93Like that guy over there with the blondes. They wouldn\'92t relate.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan adopted the part of the manager. \'93The kids need a break, Bernie,\'94 he said. \'93And the act worked in Tahoe just a couple months ago.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure it did,\'94 responded Bernie. He had heard the same line over 70,000 times in his career. He turned to Oakley and Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Kids, you\'92re great. Great. Really. But this is a \'93Liechtensteiner Polka,\'94 \'93Yellow Rose of Texas,\'94 \'93Peg O\'92 My Heart\'94 kind of crowd, ya\'92 know? I mean, if someone asks for the \'93Liechtensteiner Polka,\'94 can you do it?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, we don\'92t really play polkas,\'94 said Vivian in a line they would relate, trust me, numerous times to their children yet to be born. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See? Okay,\'94 said Bernie. \'93Look, I\'92ll put your photograph and resume in the file.\'94 He looked at Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Allan, bring \'91em back, two, three years.\'94 He turned at Vivian and Oakley and gave them some stern fatherly advice. \'93Learn a couple polkas. You know, da da dat dah, da da dat dah,\'94 singing the first few measures of the \'93Liechtensteiner Polka.\'94 \'93More tunes, then we\'92ll try again. Right now, it\'92s not a good match.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian cried softly. Oakley must have been amazed at what a great actress she was. Mom was really, really into this. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Come on,\'94 said an obviously touched Bernie. \'93It\'92s okay. Look, ever spend any time in the casinos?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I keep my clients under control, Bernie. This is strictly a business trip,\'94 said Allan. Now they were all fibbing, dissembling, misrepresenting, uttering falsehoods, practicing deception, wallowing in the untruth, lying! They were all relishing the skillful theatrical ensemble they had created. It was, however, in the interests of science, Oakley thought to himself. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s good,\'94 noted Bernie. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He pulled a small piece of paper out of his shirt pocket. \'93Look, here\'92s a toke. How many of your friends did you come up with?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93One other couple,\'94 said Vivian, without, thankfully, pointing to their manager. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 said Bernie. This is a toke for twenty dollars for each of ya\'92.\'94 He scribbled some notes on the piece of paper. \'93B K, for Bernie Kurtzman,\'94 he said showing Vivian the note. \'93Take it to any of the pit bosses. They\'92ll take care of ya\'92.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thank you,\'94 said Allan at Bernie\'92s graciousness toward his clients. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Play the slots, a little roulette, maybe a blackjack hand or two,\'94 Bernie recommended. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, I know a little bit about roulette,\'94 Oakley volunteered. \'93My friend Claude showed me. But blackjack. Too much math for me. It scares me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian covered her mouth with her hand and rubbed her upper lip as if to scratch an itch. If she hadn\'92t, Bernie would have detected a wide grin. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Don\'92t be silly,\'94 said Bernie. \'93Look, just enjoy yourselves. And don\'92t get downhearted about the act. Try it again. You guys are good. Just not a match right now for the Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sorry for wasting your time, Bernie,\'94 said Allan, smiling. This gave him an excuse for nearly laughing out loud at Oakley\'92s comment. \'93Like you say, not a good match.\'94

\fs24 \

\fs32 sionate, kind person. Our actors certainly had discovered that. He had moved to Los Angeles from Chicago at age seven with his parents Sam and Pauline (Berman), who changed her name from Pearl, and younger brother Myron in 1926. His father had seven siblings, Jack, Abe, Phil, Ben, Sara, Faye, whose name had been changed from Fanny, and Ann. They and their families had all lived in an apartment building in Chicago owned by their father, Bernie and Myron\'92s grandfather. In the economic decline 
\fs24 \

\fs32 leading to the Great Depression, the Kurtzmans lost the building, and the entire clan, one by one, had relocated to Los Angeles. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Pauline had two siblings. In a story representative of Jewish migration to the United States from Eastern Europe around the turn of the century, older sister Gussie had moved to Chicago. Pauline and her brother Oscar, being younger, had remained in Eastern Europe, perhaps Poland, with their parents, but

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 they immigrated to Chicago at a young age after their mother died and their father remarried, to a woman with a sizable number of children. Their step- mother was not particularly pleasant to her stepchildren Pauline and Oscar. In Chicago, they were reunited with Gussie. Oscar would also move with the Kurtzmans to Los Angeles. Their move was accompanied with mixed feelings, Pauline and Oscar leaving their sister Gussie, and adopted Chicago in spite of the opportunities and better weather of southern California. Many Jews were moving to the west coast for the better weather. The various Kurtzman brothers would go into business together and eventually thrive in Oriental importing and mens\'92 wear businesses. Oscar would work for two of them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Bernie lived in a modest home in Los Angeles off of Robertson Blvd. He was a successful garment salesman at an upscale Los Angeles men\'92s store, and his brother became a dentist and lived in Sherman Oaks. Both married Los Angeles-raised Jewish women. Uncle Phil, as he was known, remained close to the families of Bernie and Myron and worked for Universal Studios in the wardrobe department. He eventually married a woman he had been \'93dating\'94 when he was in his 70s. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 When he was in his 50s, Bernie\'92s two daughters and his son now grown, Bernie and his wife Freda decided to move to Nevada. It was going to be just a temporary change of life. Las Vegas was too frenetic for their gentle, homey personalities, 
\f2\i haymisha
\f1\i0 , in Yiddish, so they decided on the Reno area. Although he had planned on an early retirement, he got a little antsy and fell into the lounge manager position at Harold\'92s. He enjoyed the job, particularly helping young talent advance their careers. He felt that Oakley and Vivian, at this point, needed further preparation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 During this business meeting, Manny and Nancy were dancing. He wasn\'92t so shy as not to try to pull Nancy close to him. Nancy wasn\'92t so weak physi- cally as not to be able to keep him at a respectable distance. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See, Madeleine and Renee, they ain\'92t my kind of girls. 
\f2\i Trafe
\f1\i0 ,\'94 he said, using the Yiddish word for non-Kosher food. This was his first admission of the obvious, that Madeleine and Renee were not his relatives. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh,\'94 said Nancy.\uc0\u8232 \'93They got no class, ya\'92 know?\'94\u8232 \'93I\'92m sure they\'92re very nice,\'94 Nancy said.\u8232 \'93No, my mom, 
\f2\i a la sholom
\f1\i0 , she always said I should go with a girl like you. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 You know, intelligent, nice Jewish girl.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh. I\'92m flattered,\'94 said Nancy. As much as she sensed the come-on, she 
\fs24 \

\fs32 had to be polite. This was a business trip for Julian and his friend Dr. Thorp. Manny laughed at Nancy\'92s reply. \'93I\'92m glad. You know, my mom, she used 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to tell the 
\f2\i goyem 
\f1\i0 at Christmas \'91Merry 
\f2\i Kratz Mer
\f1\i0 .\'92 Scratch me.\'94 Nancy laughed. That was clever. They danced a bit.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Do you know what 
\f2\i bei mir bistu shein 
\f1\i0 means?\'94 he asked.\uc0\u8232 \'93Isn\'92t it a song?\'94 responded Nancy, politely but again tersely.\u8232 \'93Yeah, by The Andrews Sisters. It means \'91to me you\'92re beautiful.,\'92 ya\'92 know 
\fs24 \

\fs32 basically a grand Jewish girl. I used to try to date 
\f2\i shiksies
\f1\i0 . I\'92d ask them, \'91would you consider a thing with a short, balding, Jewish millionaire?\'92 They had a 
\f2\i goyishe kop 
\f1\i0 and they looked puzzled, so I said, \'91Well, how about three out of four?\'92 \'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nancy laughed, but again didn\'92t respond.\uc0\u8232 \'93Are you religious?\'94 said Manny, trying to revitalize the conversation.\u8232 \'93I guess,\'94 she said. She would remain polite, but wouldn\'92t provide any hope 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to Manny by offering information about herself.\uc0\u8232 \'93Not my family. On 
\f2\i Pesach 
\f1\i0 we ordered in ribs and shrimp.\'94\uc0\u8232 Nancy laughed. That was a good joke, although it sounded as if it had been 
\fs24 \

\fs32 lifted from some, well, lounge act.\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah. All Jewish holidays, ya\'92 know, are the same. They tried to kill us, we 
\fs24 \

\fs32 survived, let\'92s eat.\'94\uc0\u8232 Nancy laughed, even though this joke also sounded lifted. Manny got a 
\fs24 \

\fs32 little serious now, going in, he undoubtedly hoped, for the kill. He tried to pull Nancy closer toward him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You know, older men, they know how to treat a girl right.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh? Is that so?\'94 she replied, resisting.\u8232 \'93Yeah, it is so. Especially guys like me who gots lots of money.\'94\u8232 Nancy felt it was time to politely let Manny know that his attempts would 
\fs24 \

\fs32 not succeed.\uc0\u8232 \'93Mr. Kimmel, I love Julian. I want to grow old with him.\'94\u8232 \'93Hey, wit\'92 me you\'92re half way there,\'94 he persisted, although this time with 
\fs24 \

\fs32 an original line.\uc0\u8232 Nancy had to laugh. It was, she had to admit, an admirably quick comeback. \'93And what am I anyway, pickled herring?\'94\u8232 \'93Uh, Mr. Kimmel, I think the expression is \'91chopped liver.\'92\'94\u8232 \'93Chopped liver, pickled herring, gefilte fish. What\'92s the difference?\'94 Nancy laughed politely, although she felt manipulated, having been obvi- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ously suckered into a response. Manny stared at her and laughed, hoping he was making some progress. He showed her his diamond ring. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s nice,\'94 she replied, returning to the terse manner with which she had participated in the entire conversation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. You know I\'92m a self-made man. Born dirt poor. Dirt poor. If I hadn\'92t been born a boy I woulda had nothin\'92 to play with.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nancy laughed, but not as genuinely as she had to the growing old line. This one also seemed to be lifted from someone\'92s lounge act. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And with me, you don\'92t gotta worry about kinky stuff. Not me, but I knew a guy who became a transvestite. He wanted to eat, drink, and be Mary.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Not bad, Nancy thought to herself, even though it was a pun.\uc0\u8232 Reading Nancy\'92s reaction, Manny decided to make his move.\u8232 \'93Yeah. You know, maybe, later, you know. Maybe,\'94 said Manny, display- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ing the pessimism that Nancy\'92s reactions to him warranted. \'93Later. You, you wanna come and visit me in my room, you know?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, I\'92ll do that,\'94 said Nancy.\uc0\u8232 Manny was happily surprised, even shocked. \'93Yeah?\'94\u8232 \'93Yeah,\'94 she replied, dropping her arms from Manny\'92s shoulders. She walked 
\fs24 \

\fs32 away and turned for a second toward him.\uc0\u8232 \'93As soon as the Dalai Lama starts studying for his Bar Mitzvah.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 The afternoon following their pseudo audition, Oakley was ready to set the foundation for trying out the complete point count system that he and Julian had developed. First, as they had done at Barney\'92s in South Lake Tahoe, they would put the casino off guard by playing like unsophisticated young kids, making stupid moves and betting low stakes. Here, though, they would focus on using irrational so-called systems. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The four, Allan, Joan, Vivian, and Oakley, sat at a blackjack table at Harold\'92s. The other seats were vacant. It was an understated place, with muted green and gray colors. Oakley would get to like Harold\'92s Club both because of the quiet atmosphere and because he would always seem to win there. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Each player had bet a single $1 chip, placed neatly in the very center of their betting squares. Cocktail glasses and glasses of water stood in front of each position. The cocktail glasses were full. Even the water was barely touched. These poor young neophytes were so concerned about losing their weekly lunch money, they weren\'92t even drinking a glass of water. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Two cards, a six of Diamonds and a five of Clubs, lay face up on the table in front of the first seat to the left of the dealer, Allan\'92s place. Two cards lay on the table in front of each of the other three occupied seats, all face down. Two cards, one face up and one face down, lay in front of the dealer. The up card was a seven of Hearts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Jackie, a female dealer, about 25, stared at Allan. Clive, the pit boss, stood next to Jackie, also observing Allan.

\fs32 \cf3 Allan\'92s eyes were closed as he opened a Bible to a random page. He stuck his forefinger onto the open page of the Bible, then opened his eyes and looked at the Bible. He uttered a sigh and showed the configuration of the Bible pages and his finger to Jackie. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hebrew words,\'94 he said. \'93I stand.\'94\uc0\u8232 "Religious, huh?\'94 concluded Jackie.\u8232 \'93I believe that the Lord watches over me and guides me,\'94 Allan said righ- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 teously. \'93If my finger points at an English word, I take a card. If it\'92s a Hebrew word, I stand.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But you\'92ve got eleven,\'94 protested Jackie.\uc0\u8232 \'93The Bible says stand,\'94 said our sanctimonious one.\u8232 \'93Oh, God,\'94 said Jackie in understandable disbelief.\u8232 Allan glared at her. This was a firm believer in the ways of the Lord, and 
\fs24 \

\fs32 any heretical behavior would, if he had any means of communicating with the Supreme Being, be severely punished, if not in this life, then in the afterlife. Allan was proving to be a good actor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sorry,\'94 apologized Jackie, not wanting to irritate a client. She cleared her throat. \'93That\'92s quite a system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s the best,\'94 Allan guaranteed her. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He communicated his conviction with a mixture of near sexual passion and the deepest religious faith. Poor guy, Jackie must have thought. His girlfriend probably wore an overcoat to bed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s better than the other systems we see,\'94 interjected Clive. \'93Sure, some- times they get lucky. Just like when a lamb goes to the slaughter, the lamb might kill the butcher. But I\'92ll always bet on the butcher.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, remembering the butcher story from Barney\'92s, thought it must have been a line taught at the Pit Boss Institute of Technology. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We\'92re vegetarians,\'94 chimed in Vivian, she too remembering the episode at Barney\'92s. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You meet all kinds,\'94 said Jackie, trying to lighten up the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There was a guy from Illinois,\'94 recalled Clive. \'93Called himself the Stargazer. Had some kind of magic toy slot machine. He rolled it before every hand. If it came up cherries, he bet. If not, he laid out. And darned it but he usually seemed to bet right.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Heresy!\'94 exclaimed Allan. \'93I put my trust in the Lord, not in pagan instru- ments or the devil\'92s toys.\'94 Oakley thought that Allan was putting it on a bit too much. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A real character,\'94 continued Clive. \'93He used to order drinks, liqueurs, the expensive stuff, and never drink \'91em. Had a bottle hidden behind one of the slot machines. He\'92d leave the table and pour the booze into the bottle.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Talk about coming for the free drinks,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Clive pointed to the cocktail glasses on the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sort of like you kids, huh? It\'92s fine. But maybe you should learn how to play blackjack a little better.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This is exactly how I always play,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Same strategy. I stand at twelve or above so I never go over twenty-one.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Me, too,\'94 added Allan. \'93I always count on the Lord.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley would later tell me about the Stargazer. Apparently he had a lot in common with him, and they by some quirk of fate, became acquainted through mutual friends in the UCLA math department. The Stargazer was a graduate student in astronomy from Berkeley, although Vivian said she had never met him. He apparently had been one of the founders of the University of California Jazz Ensembles, the group for which Vivian was a vocalist. You recall she met Oakley at the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had played very low stakes poker games with his twin brother and bud- dies during high school, and a little blackjack. In preparation for the first trip of the band to the Reno Jazz Festival, under the direction of David Tucker, who was also the director under whom Vivian sang, he read a book on black- jack by Oswald Jacoby, the bridge maven that he had bought at the famous Moe\'92s Bookstore on Telegraph Avenue. To prepare, he and his girlfriend, Diane Dring, whose mother had been a vocalist herself, practiced in the din of the Bear\'92s Lair snack room on the Berkeley campus. Having never been to an actual casino, he wanted to simulate its noise and distractions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The Stargazer was sufficiently successful on that Reno Jazz Festival trip that he would make monthly trips to Reno for the rest of his graduate student days at Berkeley. He\'92d leave on a Sunday afternoon, when the other casino play- ers would be returning to the Bay Area, and stay through Tuesday afternoon. The chartered bus that the residents of Chinatown would take to Reno and back, the \'93chicken soup express,\'94 so named because the Chinese would bring containers of chicken soup with them from San Francisco for the 3 1/4 hour trip, would be packing up to leave as the Stargazer arrived. He always stayed at a small hotel, the El Cortez, that in any other city would have been a brothel or vagrant\'92s destination. It\'92s still there in Reno, west of Virginia Street, a small hotel, with a red neon sign, and single elevator right there in the small, do- not-tell, front lobby. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Despite betting low amounts, the Stargazer\'92s frequent visits began to draw attention. After all, even if you win only $50 at a shift, that\'92s $100 that the casino has to make up to earn their $50. So, as Oakley told me, the Stargazer came up with booze as a camouflage technique. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If you\'92re a serious player, you should never drink while playing. Among other things, it interferes with your rational decision making. The Stargazer, who Oakley told me was also an accomplished actor, played the lush to hide

\fs32 \cf3 being a systems player. Before sitting at a table, he would dab some booze on his neck, face, and hands so he would emit that telltale fragrance. This, Oakley recalled, was exactly one of the camouflage techniques suggested by Manny during the Brookline visit. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Immediately upon sitting down, the Stargazer would order a drink, straight, no rocks, and if it didn\'92t arrive quickly he\'92d make a small fuss. He didn\'92t order the usual Scotch or bourbon, but the expensive liqueurs, amaretto, kah- lua, and cr\'e8me de menthe. He\'92d pretend to take a hit from time to time but wouldn\'92t really drink. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 When his session was over, he would stumble slightly on leaving the table saying, \'93Time to try the slots.\'94 Even that statement was a camouflage, imply- ing he was a gambler. No system exists at the slot machines. He would walk over to the rows of slot machines and pour whatever drink he had into a bottle he had hidden between a couple of the slot machines. Judging from Clive the pit boss\'92 comments, the casinos eventually caught on to the hidden bottle trick. Nonetheless, as you\'92ll see, Oakley would learn from the Stargazer. He would later develop and use camouflage techniques of his own. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Here, at Harold\'92s Club, they were already using some. They were pretend- ing to be mooching drinks, again as Manny had suggested, and playing based on faith and superstition, in Allan\'92s case, and playing using na\'efve systems, the \'93do not bust\'94 strategy, in Oakley\'92s case. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was evening. Oakley, Vivian, Allan, Joan, Julian, and Nancy had enjoyed a nice dinner at the Riverside Hotel, later to be known as Jessie Beck\'92s Riverside. To get there from the main casino strip on Virginia Street you had to cross what everyone referred to as the river. It was, by name, the Truckee River, although in Reno it was no more than a large, lazy stream rather than a broad expanse reminiscent of the great American rivers or even the rushing Truckee further up the mountains near its source. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They sat down on a couple of benches facing the river and listened to the sounds of the reclaimed desert night. Oakley had been thinking about the entire escapade, learning a system, trying out the system, proving the skeptics wrong. He was wondering about the place of such ventures in the fabric of one\'92s life. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had pointed out Venus in the sky, only a month past eastern elongation, making it startlingly bright in the early evening hours, and his friends were enthralled by it and the multitude of other stars visible in the non-polluted skies over Reno. One day, he had told Vivian, he wanted to build an astro- nomical observatory to indulge his interest in that subject. Some birds scam- pered along the river edge, looking for seeds fallen from the trees growing on 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the river bank. Joan noted that they were probably vegetarians and that the worms there were safe. They watched the birds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We\'92re born to die,\'94 Oakley said, breaking the silence. \'93You start to die when you watch those you love die. That\'92s what \'91over the hill\'92 means. What hill? You\'92re over the hill when those you love have died.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Whoa,\'94 exclaimed Allan. \'93Where did that come from, Ed?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That sounds like a Jewish piece of wisdom,\'94 noted Julian. \'93We\'92re born to die.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re exactly right, Julian,\'94 said Vivian. \'93I learned the phrase from my parents, Abe and Adele. And this guy learned it from me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t care if it\'92s your dog or your parakeet or your parents,\'94 continued Oakley. That\'92s when the sense of humor starts to go and you stop caring about life. You let yourself go physically and don\'92t eat well. You\'92re getting ready to die.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well,\'94 said Vivian, \'93I hope most people wait a few decades after those events have hit their lives.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93All of life is full of highs and lows,\'94 said Nancy. \'93My uncle Eliezer Moshe always says, \'91As night follows day, 
\f2\i tsouris 
\f1\i0 follows 
\f2\i nachas
\f1\i0 ,\'92 misery and joy.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93So why do we screw?\'94 asked Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Where\'92d that come from?\'94 Vivian said, repeating Allan\'92s comment. \'93That\'92s not the question,\'94 said Oakley. \'93That\'92s the wrong question. The 
\fs24 \

\fs32 question is why does it feel so good to screw?\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93I remember reading 
\f2\i Of Human Bondage 
\f1\i0 by Somerset Maugham in high school. It tried to answer the question of \'91what is the meaning of life?\'92\'94 Julian said, the beginning of a presentation that Nancy had heard before. Nancy thought that he must have been seriously affected by that book. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If you want to learn about the meaning of life you\'92ve got to look at sex,\'94 Allan persisted. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Now we\'92re talking,\'94 said Joan, playfully pushing her elbow into Allan\'92s ribs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Porno movies!\'94 said Allan. \'93You can learn everything you need to know about life from porno movies.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You are so silly, Allan,\'94 said Nancy.\uc0\u8232 \'93I place great import on them because I\'92m so well endowed.\'94\u8232 \'93Don\'92t get too personal, Allan,\'94 cautioned Joan.\u8232 \'93I\'92ll just say that I\'92m three inches,\'94 he countered.\u8232 \'93I don\'92t think most statisticians would classify that as \'91well endowed,\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 observed Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh, I\'92m sorry. That\'92s three inches . . . from the ground,\'94 replied Allan with 
\fs24 \

\fs32 surprisingly adroit comic timing.\uc0\u8232 They all laughed heartily.\u8232 \'93Isn\'92t the meaning of life simply to provide food for the species next higher 
\fs24 \

\fs32 on the food chain?\'94 suggested Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93If you\'92re a carnivore,\'94 replied Allan.\u8232 \'93No,\'94 answered Oakley. \'93Plants survive in part on soil, which is in part 
\fs24 \

\fs32 decayed vegetable matter. Herbivores, be they plant or animal, survive as being higher on the food chain. My wife is undoubtedly right, as usual.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian snickered. \'93Everybody look at Vivian,\'94 commanded Oakley. \'93Notice the wrinkled nose? She wrinkles her nose when she laughs.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I used to think, and I thought this was a great answer, that the meaning of life was to gain immortality,\'94 said Julian, getting back to the moribund. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, I like that,\'94 said Vivian. Her husband\'92s colleague Julian was a philosopher. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We live so that we never die,\'94 Julian repeated the philosophy of death he had described to Nancy the first time they had visited Buckingham Fountain. \'93Some people give money to name a library after themselves. Some write books. Some get rich enough to endow an academic chair in their name. Maybe one of us, God willing. These all accomplish their end of achieving immortality.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That may be true, and it may not be true,\'94 said Allan, perhaps playing the party pooper as well as the devil\'92s advocate. \'93But, have any of you ever watched two flies having sex?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Not recently,\'94 admitted Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Or two moths? Or two spiders?\'94 Allan asked, obviously being serious about the line of questioning. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Moths, no. Spiders, yes,\'94 said Oakley, supporting his friend Allan Wilson in whatever monologue he was rehearsing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They stay attached forever,\'94 said Allan, \'93as long as you have patience to watch. That means, my friends, they experience the same pleasure we do.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Or they didn\'92t read the complete instruction manual,\'94 Joan noted rakishly. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mammals, fish, insects, reptiles,\'94 Allan continued. \'93Amphibians, whatever they are, for that matter. It\'92s ingrained in evolution.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And they\'92re not thinking of immortality,\'94 noted Julian. \'93Perhaps I should reconsider my hypothesis.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, at least in humans you can keep the immortality concept,\'94 said Nancy, still believing in Julian\'92s hypothesis, and wanting to buoy up her man. \'93Yeah,\'94 said Oakley. \'93But love of sex came with evolution, from four and one-half billion years ago. What\'92s the drive? Are you saying the meaning of life is to enjoy sex?\'94 Oakley asked Allan. \'93Then you do get pleasure and propaga- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 tion. And it\'92s the same in every animal.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Maybe even in plants,\'94 threw in Vivian.\u8232 \'93Pleasure and propagation,\'94 added Julian, perhaps conceding. \'93Those are 
\fs24 \

\fs32 worthy evolutionary goals.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93That\'92s an interesting idea, guys,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 \'93Where does being a mathematician come in?\'94 asked Oakley.\u8232 \'93And gambling?\'94 added Julian to the conundrum.\u8232 \'93We\'92ll discuss those issues next time, class,\'94 said Professor Thorp at the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 tightening intellectual bottleneck.\uc0\u8232 \'93No, really, what\'92s the point of intellect in general if the meaning of life 
\fs24 \

\fs32 is pleasure and propagation?\'94 asked Nancy. Maybe she was still hoping for votes for Julian, or maybe she had just decided to join in the direction of the discussion. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Obvious. It gives pleasure,\'94 answered Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93Okay, I\'92ll go along with that,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 \'93But, if there are alternative means of gaining pleasure, then wouldn\'92t they 
\fs24 \

\fs32 provide a disincentive to sex?\'94 suggested Julian. \'93Then intellect is counterpro- ductive to your suggested meaning of life.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t think so,\'94 countered Oakley. \'93It\'92s like the uncertainty principle. Sex and intellect are conjugate pairs.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You mean conjugal pairs, darling,\'94 said Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93No, conjugate in the uncertainty principle sense.\'94\u8232 \'93Right,\'94 agreed Allan. Vivian was only slightly embarrassed at her math- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ematical 
\f2\i faux pas, 
\f1\i0 grateful that her lack of knowledge of mathematical physics hadn\'92t led Thorp, Allan, or Julian to utter even mild words of scorn.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93You give a little in one area to gain a little in the other,\'94 expostulated Oakley, now firmly ensconced in professor mode. \'93Non-sex pleasure is still pleasure, but it\'92s less sex. It means less sex.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right,\'94 said Julian. \'93Studying time eliminates some dating time.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Let delta 
\f2\i x 
\f1\i0 be the contribution of sex to pleasure and delta 
\f2\i p 
\f1\i0 be the contri- bution of intellect to pleasure,\'94 said Allan, scribbling figures on a blackboard in the air. \'93You can\'92t have refined, that is, precise, values for both,\'94 continued Allan, now leaving the girls behind, as well as perhaps Oakley and Julian, if not in the physics then perhaps in the reasoning. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And immortality fits right in, Julian,\'94 Oakley reassured him, puzzled a bit himself at Allan\'92s application of Herr Professor Heisenberg\'92s uncertainty principle. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, you can\'92t get laid in the grave,\'94 said Allan. \'93So it must give you pleasure.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Which?\'94 said a puzzled Nancy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, although you can\'92t get laid in the grave, your intellectual contribu- tions continue, providing immortality and pleasure to your, well, ghost, I guess, and others.\'94 Allan had gotten a little far afield even for himself. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What a great name for a country tune,\'94 stated Joan. \'93You Can\'92t Get Laid in the Grave.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ll forget you said that,\'94 Oakley said to her.\uc0\u8232 \'93Edward hates country music,\'94 Vivian said.\u8232 \'93They all sound like they have terminal nasal congestion,\'94 Oakley said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Give me Ella, Mel Torme, Frank D\'92Rone, or Chet Baker, or give me death,\'94 he exclaimed. \'93But, Julian\'92s right,\'94 he added, getting back to the subject at hand. \'93Getting your name on a book or funding a library gives you and oth- ers pleasure.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But probably not you if you\'92re in the grave,\'94 noted Nancy, questioning Allan\'92s thesis. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m glad you didn\'92t want to be a lawyer,\'94 Vivian said to Oakley. Allan and Joan joined Oakley and Vivian in chuckling at the early days of the Thorps\'92 courtship. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right. What pleasure do they provide?\'94 asked Julian, Socratically. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t think they provide any,\'94 said Allan. \'93But they make money and that means more sex for them and their clients, if they won.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And misery for those who lost,\'94 added Joan.\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s the uncertainty principle heavily weighted on sex,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Right,\'94 agreed Allan, his mind perhaps a little clearer.\u8232 \'93Most people have the opportunity to get pleasure from both sex and intel- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 lect,\'94 said Vivian. She elbowed Oakley in the ribs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Except Catholic priests,\'94 said Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That was one of the most ignorant restrictions in human history, and ironically it was made by the heads of Gregor Mendel\'92s faith,\'94 said Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A case in point,\'94 Nancy noted. \'93He was after all a monk.\'94 Julian turned and stared at her with a querulous, mildly disdainful, look. Nancy really didn\'92t have to state that to this highly educated bunch. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If he had been alive then he would have explained its idiocy to the cardi- nals and the pope. Books were only available in monasteries,\'94 explained Julian. \'93Yeah, you want to read books, you want to gain knowledge, then you can\'92t screw anymore!\'94 commanded Allan in his colorful manner, standing up. He stuck his arm into the air, stretched out his index finger, and preached. \'93And if you do you\'92ll rot in hell for committing the sin!\'94 Allan was practicing his 
\fs24 \

\fs32 evangelicalism. Joan grabbed him by the arm and yanked him down.\uc0\u8232 \'93If you wanted to be scholarly you had to suffer,\'94 lamented Oakley, some- how commiserating with scholarly brethren of long-ago centuries. \'93The pro- hibition selectively removed the high I.Q.\'92s from the Catholic gene pool for hundreds of years, from the 12th century until the printing press became 
\fs24 \

\fs32 common, dozens of generations,\'94 he observed.\uc0\u8232 \'93It just boggles the imagination. Couldn\'92t the popes see that smart people 
\fs24 \

\fs32 have smart children?\'94 wondered Vivian incredulously.\uc0\u8232 \'93The Catholics say you gain immortality by being a good person. That\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 another way,\'94 said Julian.\uc0\u8232 \'93I partially disagree,\'94 said Allan. \'93The Catholics say you gain immortality 
\fs24 \

\fs32 by being a good Catholic. It\'92s the myth of the afterlife reborn as big business.\'94 \'93I agree with Allan,\'94 said Joan. \'93The Catholics are hypocrites. You can dis- obey the Ten Commandments, you can bear false witness against your neigh- bor and sleep with your neighbor\'92s wife and commit murder, but as long as you put five dollars in the collection plate and chomp on a cracker every 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Sunday you get to reside in heaven for eternity with Jesus and all the saints.\'94 \'93Thank you, sweetheart. In other words,\'94 concluded Allan, \'93you can harm your fellow man, but it\'92s all excused if you just donate. That\'92s what their con- fession is, isn\'92t it? Go into some dark chamber, tell me you\'92re sorry, and then put some penance money in the plate and then Jesus and I will forgive your sin and it\'92s okay if you got Mr. Whatzit convicted of a crime he didn\'92t com- mit because you happily committed perjury out of grand revenge or you slept 
\fs24 \

\fs32 with Mrs. Whozat.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93One fall, I had to attend a conference at Cornell,\'94 said Julian. \'93So I took 
\fs24 \

\fs32 the Twentieth Century Limited train from Chicago to Syracuse and then went to the Greyhound station to take a bus to Ithaca. There, I got into a conversation with a young man from a small town in Iowa who was to begin

\fs32 \cf3 his freshman year at Cornell. Somehow the conversation got around to Jews, maybe the large number of Jews who attend Cornell, and when I told him I was Jewish he looked puzzled and told me I was the first Jew he had ever met.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There aren\'92t a lot of Jewish corn farmers,\'94 noted Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. So, he asked me if he could look at my forehead. I had no idea what he was thinking, but I said, \'91okay,\'92 and he started to part the hair over my forehead. After a couple seconds he said, \'91You don\'92t have horns.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re kidding,\'94 said Joan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, really, he was looking for my horns. So he said, \'91My pastor taught us that Jews have horns.\'92 \'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s part of the business model of the Christian church to propagate igno- rance, intolerance, and bigotry,\'94 observed Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Those intellectually-gifted Iowa preachers,\'94 commented Joan.\uc0\u8232 \'93Passing on their bigotry to their children and their flock,\'94 added Oakley. \'93Well, what did you say?\'94 asked Vivian.\u8232 \'93I told him Jews don\'92t have horns,\'94 said Julian. He paused. \'93Cloven hooves, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 sure, but horns!?\'94\uc0\u8232 To this clever joke, uncharacteristic of Julian, they all laughed uproariously. \'93The father of one of my girl friends growing up was a minister. She took 
\fs24 \

\fs32 me to church one Sunday and I\'92ll never forget what he said,\'94 said Joan. \'93What?\'94 asked Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93He said, \'91He who spills his seed upon the soil of the Earth shall reap the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 harvest of eternal damnation.\'92\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93How poetic,\'94 said Vivian, the English major.\u8232 \'93How visual,\'94 noted Allan.\u8232 \'93When I was a little boy in Chicago,\'94 recalled Oakley, \'93the Jews wanted 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to build a synagogue a couple miles from our house, right across the street from a Dominican priory. To get it approved by the town, they had to say the permit was for a bowling alley or an apartment building, but once it was obvi- ous it was going to be a synagogue, maybe there was a sign posted, the good Dominican friars stood across the street on the sidewalk in their cloaks and yelled anti-Semitic taunts. Very nice people. Enlightened, progressive bigots.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It was Vivian\'92s turn. \'93As far as I\'92m concerned, Catholicism and Christianity in general are untenable philosophically. The priests took perhaps the greatest intellectual achievement of all time, the concept of monotheism introduced by the Jews, and made a mockery of it. They started with the virgin birth mythology, then the trinity, and then the saints. No, I\'92m sorry, there is only one God, not three, not a hundred.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Actually,\'94 added Oakley, \'93humans can have virgin conception, but since the female only carries the female gene, the child can only be a female. So Jesus, by this logic, had to have been a woman.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s interesting,\'94 chuckled Julian. \'93But the saints like Vivian said are my favorite, performing miracles. The patron saint of this and the patron saint of that. It\'92s paganism all over again.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well,\'94 said Nancy, \'93at least the Catholics brought civilization with them to the New World.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right, those enlightened Spanish conquistadores, claiming the New World for Jesus,\'94 Allan observed. \'93They brought civilization, along with smallpox, typhus, yellow fever, bubonic plague, syphilis, influenza, physi- cal atrocities, and murder, annihilating the sophisticated native American cultures, the Incas, Mayas, Aztecs, Toltecs, whatever, with their advanced agricultural, architectural, city planning, and astronomical knowledge. Sixty million by the end of the 16th century by some accounts. A significant fraction of the human race existing at that time. At least twenty million in Mexico alone. Some areas in the Americas had population loss of 90%, about three times greater than in Europe and Asia during the Black Death. Very civilized, Nancy.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Quite a lecture,\'94 observed Joan.\uc0\u8232 \'93There are other theories of course,\'94 noted Oakley.\u8232 \'93Okay,\'94 conceded Allan. \'93But throw in the genocide and intolerance that 
\fs24 \

\fs32 was the Crusades and the Inquisition, mass murder of so-called pagans who would not adopt Catholicism and so-called heretics, the murderous Knights of the Order, Catholic-run extermination camps in World War II, and you can make the case that the Catholic Church has been the single most destruc- tive force in the history of civilization, and over hundreds of years. Forget it if you were a Jew.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, at least they gave Galileo a bed and Giordano Bruno was kept warm as toast,\'94 said Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Funny. I\'92m sure Galileo had all the water he needed. Unfortunately, that wasn\'92t the case with Bruno,\'94 lamented Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Talking about drinks, my dance band the Deuces played for an Irish wed- ding,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 said Allan. \'93You have my permission to change the subject.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thank you, sir. So, two guys came up to the bandstand with a six-month old baby and gave him a sip of booze, and when he vomited they all laughed like it was a coming of age, getting drunk.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The Irish. A nationality of alcoholics of low I.Q.\'92s,\'94 concluded Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s an example of genetic drift,\'94 lectured Julian. \'93An event alters the gene pool of a population. It\'92s why Ashkenazi Jews, who encouraged their rabbis and biblical scholars to have large families by supporting them finan- cially, but were isolated socially from the rest of Europeans, have as a group high intelligence. Every Jew living today is probably descended from a

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We need cops and firemen,\'94 said Nancy\uc0\u8232 .\'93And politicians,\'94 added Vivian.\u8232 \'93We don\'92t need them,\'94 said Joan.\u8232 \'93And they all have the same thing in common. Below average I.Q.\'92s result- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ing from selective depletion of the tail of the intelligence distribution,\'94 Oakley concluded. \'93It severely limits their career options.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Some priests had children,\'94 said Joan, suggesting a flaw in the argument. \'93I will not hear of such heresy!\'94 remonstrated Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93If I had to make the choice, I\'92d pick the monastery,\'94 said Oakley. It was his 
\fs24 \

\fs32 turn to poke Vivian in the ribs.\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, sweetheart,\'94 Vivian said to Oakley. \'93Then we just won\'92t have 
\fs24 \

\fs32 children.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93I guess I\'92ll just have to write a lot of books for my pleasure,\'94 teased Oakley. \'93Books about our glorious love affair, I hope,\'94 she said.\u8232 \'93It\'92s true,\'94 Allan interjected. \'93Every woman thinks the greatest story is 
\fs24 \

\fs32 about her love affairs.\'94\uc0\u8232 Vivian, Nancy, and Joan laughed. \'93Well, I married Edward Oakley after 
\fs24 \

\fs32 being serenaded by his trumpet at a jazz festival. That certainly qualifies as one of the great love stories,\'94 said Vivian, poking Oakley in the ribs, again. He began to wonder if his spleen, whatever its function, would survive the evening. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I knew a woman, before Joan, of course, who was writing a novel about her love life,\'94 said Allan. \'93And she repeatedly used the phrase \'91all right\'92 instead of \'91okay.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nobody, and I speak authoritatively as an English major, uses the phrase \'91all right\'92 except unskilled novelists,\'94 Vivian agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And as a mathematician who married an English major, I concur,\'94 chipped in Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And as a programmer who knows a mathematician who married an English major, I would also have to agree,\'94 said Julian, following the logic. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They all laughed at the joy their minds provided them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93One of my writer pet peeves is the use of the word \'91beautiful,\'92\'94 said Vivian the English major. \'93It denotes nothing but approbation, that you like some- thing. It\'92s symptomatic of a lazy mind. Like using adverbs instead of searching for the right verb,\'94 she lamented. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93A classmate of mine at Cornell wrote a quantum mechanics text,\'94 Oakley added, \'93and the first sentence in the book was, \'91Quantum mechanics is beau- tiful because it works.\'92\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Exactly,\'94 said Vivian. \'93That only means that he likes it.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93He could have written that quantum mechanics is an ingenious construct of the human mind, demonstrating our ability to model nature in a manner that yields predictions and provides uncountable practical applications,\'94 said Julian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right,\'94 said Vivian. \'93Then we know why he finds it attractive.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93When I was in high school, I took a summer class in public speaking,\'94 said Julian. \'93One of our assignments was to describe something beautiful without actually using the word.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Now that was a good teacher,\'94 Joan noted. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. Carroll Anderson,\'94 recalled Julian. \'93So I described driving with my parents through Florida en route to Miami Beach for winter vacation and watching the rows of orange trees stretch out in perfect alignment as far as you could see as you drove past them on the highway.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Did you use the word \'91beautiful\'92?\'94 asked Nancy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, I\'92m not sure. If I did, it was only once,\'94 said Julian defending any pos- sible intellectual lapse, \'93until I knew that Mr. Anderson was making a black mark in his mental grade book.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Beautiful,\'94 approved Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And if I did, it was because I was staring at Diana Movius. She was an actress and singer in high school.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uh, who\'94? asked Nancy, playing at being jealous. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Since we\'92re talking about love lives, the concept of love-life novels was the basis of one of my great lines to women, B. M. J., of course,\'94 said Allan. He had skillfully used the reference to whomever that high school girl was to get back to the discussion which had been short circuited by reflections on the word \'93beautiful.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93B. M. J.?\'94 asked Vivian.\uc0\u8232 \'93Before my Joan,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 They all laughed.\u8232 \'93I used to tell the girls, you are so interesting, so intriguing, we should write 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a book about you.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93It didn\'92t work with me,\'94 said Joan.\u8232 \'93No, I had to take you out to dinner a few dozen times first,\'94 said Allan. \'93Good for you, Joan,\'94 said Vivian. \'93Take these math geniuses for all they\'92re 
\fs24 \

\fs32 worth.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Julian won me over with a game of chess,\'94 said Nancy, kissing him on the cheek. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Such a charming man,\'94 observed Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The three couples cuddled, caressed by the sounds of the evening. Allan must have gotten uneasy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This river reminds me of the cabin we had when I was a kid. There was nothing to do in the boring little town. One day I went down to the beach and watched the tide go out. It never came back.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Good one,\'94 laughed Oakley, revived from his reverie.\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah, you entered town and we had one traffic sign. Resume speed.\'94 They all laughed. Allan had obviously performed this material in the past. \'93My favorite traffic sign is \'91soft shoulders,\'92 \'93said Vivian, massaging Oakley\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 shoulders.\uc0\u8232 \'93Mine, too,\'94 said Joan, attacking Allan\'92s.\u8232 \'93And mine,\'94 chimed in Nancy, kissing Julian on the cheek.\u8232 The levity and intellectual sparing of the evening had functioned as resting 
\fs24 \

\fs32 his brain before Oakley\'92s final exam. A little more riverside bantering and star- ing at reflecting and radiating dots of light in the night sky would stretch into the evening, but soon they would hit the tables.

\fs32 \cf3 Julian and Nancy excused themselves, but the others returned to Harold\'92s Club to try out the complete point count system. Manny, unlike in the diver- sionary afternoon session, was intent on watching. He, with Oakley, Vivian, Allan, and Joan, walked north across the bridge. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Now with serious gambling time approaching, Oakley hoped that he would face no difficulty from the pit boss, that he would not be taken as a serious threat to Harold\'92s profits. That was the point of the gambling during the afternoon. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Reno was a good place to try out Julian and Oakley\'92s system. Las Vegas is for vacationers from all over the world, those who are willing to spend a lot of money on lavish rooms, dinners, shows, and gambling, or just to be able to say they were going to \'93Vegas,\'94 implying they were adventurous and oblivious to danger, a modern swashbuckler. South Lake Tahoe draws people from the Bay Area for its skiing, scenic woods and lakes, and romance, with gambling a side attraction. South Lake Tahoe is, strictly speaking, a vacation rather than gambling destination. I think I noted that before. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Reno, though, is a gambler\'92s town. In Las Vegas, unless you\'92re playing downtown, you need a car to go from casino to casino. In Reno, they are side to side on Virginia Street, smaller venues like the Money Tree, Silver Spur, and Primadonna, as well as the big name operators such as Harrah\'92s, Harold\'92s Club, Fitzgerald\'92s, the Cal Neva, the Mapes Hotel and, across the river, the Riverside Hotel. Virginia Street is almost congested, like the stores on a strip mall. It reminded Oakley of the portside merchant stalls in Madras, India, where he had given a paper at the renowned Presidency College at a

\fs32 \cf3 symposium to honor the great astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a 1930 graduate of that university who would win the Nobel Prize for his work in developing the theory of stellar structure and evolution. Each such stall shared a wall with its neighbors, with a single merchant seated at a chair at its front. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Before returning to Harold\'92s Club, Oakley and Allan decided to warm up at a couple of the smaller casinos. Call them practice sessions. At the small Money Tree, having only two tables, Oakley bet $10 to $100 depending on the value of the high-low index, and within minutes won about $250. He stayed for several more hours and won another $400 or so. Manny, Vivian, and Joan watched. A trip for fun with your girlfriends and, perhaps, your father, makes for excellent camouflage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Then they walked over to the Silver Spur, for their second and final warm- up. Feeling more at ease with the system, Oakley\'92s betting now ranged from $25 to $250. In fifteen minutes, he rang up another $500 in winnings. Allan was playing the basic strategy at the same table, having not studied the com- plete point count. That these friends did not make the same strategy decisions provided another effective camouflage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nonetheless, Oakley\'92s winnings led the dealer to lean forward over the table and press a concealed button on the floor with her foot, a call to casino management. Two managers appeared, exchanged greetings with Oakley and his friends, and then instructed the dealer to shuffle the deck between 12 and 15 cards from the end. Casinos had learned, over the previous decade, that some players would wait until near the end of the deck and then jump their bets from $1 to as much as $500. Not knowing what the players were doing, but realizing they were cashing in, the dealers would be instructed to shuffle the deck five to ten cards from the end. Management had decided that Oakley was one such player. Oakley would later take great advantage of what he would call \'93end play.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Yet the ensuing decks were favorable, with positive high-low indices, and Oakley continued to win. Management returned and told the dealer to shuffle 25 cards from the end. Allan now decided to lay out, letting Oakley play by himself. The decks continued to favor Oakley, and he continued to win. Management returned again, and told the dealer to shuffle 42 cards from the end of the deck, after only two hands had been dealt. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley continued to play for another twenty minutes or so. Despite the deck becoming unfavorable, the house possessing some unfavorable table rules, and the early shuffling, Oakley was able to win another $80. With win- nings of nearly $2000, it seemed pointless to continue at the truncated-deck addicted Silver Spur.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 With hours of practice behind him, Oakley and his entourage of hardened gamblers moved on to Harold\'92s Club for the kill. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley purchased $2000 in chips from the cashier and then he and Allan sat at a blackjack table set against the wall in what could best be described as a corridor between two large gambling rooms. They hoped that they could have the table to themselves, gamblers preferring the glitz of the larger rooms. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 During the next couple of hours, much of the time Oakley and Allan did have the fortune of having no other players at the table. Yet Oakley had the misfortune, to use an inappropriate term, of losing steadily. The point count had frequently been negative, leading him to usually bet his minimum $25. Yet, he was down nearly $1700, which nearly wiped out all of his earnings at the Money Tree and Silver Spur. He was, understandably, discouraged. He fought off any thoughts that although the complete point count system was sure to win in the long run, perhaps, in the more realistic short run, streaks of bad luck would make the system non-viable. Perhaps that book that he and Julian had planned on writing would not be written. Maybe he should just publish his dissertation, the traditional manner of advancing one\'92s nascent academic career. It would certainly please Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan was taking frequent breaks, letting Oakley play heads-up against the dealer. When he did play, he was also losing, but, not playing Oakley\'92s stakes, the amount was only a hundred dollars or so. Then things changed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had laid down a bet of three hundred dollars in $25 chips. Allan, playing to Oakley\'92s left, had bet $20, four $5 chips. Their two cards were face down. Joan, Vivian, and Manny stood behind them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Jo, the dealer, had an up-card of the six of Clubs. The only other witness was Elroy, the pit boss, who stood behind Jo watching the action. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Excluding the burned card, which had not been viewed and which was therefore, according to Oakley\'92s complete point count system, not to be included in the tallies, 16 cards had been played out of a newly shuffled deck. The point count before the hand he now held had been +9. The high-low index had therefore been +9/36 \'d7 100, or +25, calling for a bet of 12 units of Oakley\'92s minimum bet of $25, or $300. This was the table maximum at some Reno casinos, a large bet, but not at Harold\'92s, where the table maximum was $500. Betting the table maximum would certainly have attracted significant management attention. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley held a pair of eights, the eight of Clubs and the eight of Diamonds, each of point value zero. Jo\'92s up-card of six had a point value of +1. The updated point count, which Oakley referred to as the \'93running count,\'94 was therefore now +10, and the high-low index was +10/33 \'d7 100, or about +30. In the simple point count system the point count was only updated after 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 Never Split Tens 
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 all the cards had been played, as a guide to the bet for the next hand. In the complete point count system, the running count, obtained by adjusting the point count as every card was dealt and seen, was kept to guide the play of the hand in progress. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley flipped over his two cards. He separated them, indicating he was going to split the pair. This is a standard bet for anyone with the minimum knowledge of blackjack, sixteen being a lousy hand. Oakley didn\'92t have enough chips on the table to cover the entire bet, but when you split a pair blackjack rules at the vast majority of casinos require you to match the origi- nal bet, and Oakley wanted to do so. He was too involved in the hand to even consider playing dumb. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. He removed three $100 bills and placed them on the table next to the eight of Diamonds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Money plays,\'94 announced Jo. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She dealt the three of Clubs next to the eight of Diamonds and the ten of Hearts next to the eight of Clubs. With point values of +1 and \'961, these cards canceled each other out. The high-low index was now +10/31 \'d7 100, or about +33. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley pulled out another three $100 bills from his wallet and placed them next to the eight of Diamonds. Even the basic strategy directed, as most all players know, that you double down with a hard total of 11 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 6. The complete point count tables that he and Julian had developed said to double down when the high-low index exceeded \uc0\u8722 35. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Such an exceedingly large negative index would result from, for example, a point count of \uc0\u8722 7 with only twenty cards remaining in the deck to be played, \'967/20 \'d7 100 = \'9635. That meant, of the twenty remaining cards, at least seven, the exact number depending on the number of ten-value cards or Aces also remaining, would need to have point values of +1, the 2\'92s through 6\'92s. If, for example, four ten-value cards or Aces were present, then the deck would have to have eleven of these low-value cards, the rest being the sevens, eights, and nines, with zero point value. Other than such unfavorable situations, the complete point count system directs the player to double down with a hard 11 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 6. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Double.\'94 Perhaps Oakley was getting carried away. The term for doubling your bet is \'93double-down.\'94 One needs a fair amount of experience to feel comfortable using the abbreviated term, and the whole point of the diversion in the afternoon was to convince the casino that he was not an experienced player. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian was alarmed by the amount of money Oakley had wagered. \'93$900, Edward,\'94 she advised.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Money plays,\'94 Jo announced to the assembled throng. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She dealt the seven of Clubs next to the three of Clubs and pointed to Oakley, a non-verbal query if he wanted to take another card. He had an 18, a standing hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley waved his hand over the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stand.\'94 Again, Oakley could have avoided the wave of the hand gesture and simply said \'93I\'92ll stand\'94 or \'93I think I\'92m okay.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Jo pointed to Oakley\'92s hand containing the ten of Hearts next to the eight of Clubs, with the same query. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stand.\'94 I guess it could be expected, with the money on the table in their first real test of the complete point count system, but a little banter might have led Jo, Elroy, or anyone observing from the one-way mirrors in the sky to think, as desired, that he was not a serious player. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s hands played, Jo pointed to Allan.\uc0\u8232 \'93I\'92ll take a card,\'94 Allan said.\u8232 Jo dealt Allan the nine of Spades. She flipped over his cards to reveal the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 nine of Clubs and the seven of Diamonds. When Allan had called for a card, the high-low index had been +10/30 \'d7 100, or still +33, Oakley calculated. Allan should have stood with his 16 against the dealer\'92s 5, the complete point count system directing the player to stand if the high-low index exceeded \uc0\u8722 34. Oakley was not surprised that Allan had busted. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As I said, Allan had not had the time to study the system, and, in retro- spect, Oakley thought, his gambling buddy not utilizing the same strategies was, as it was at the Silver Spur earlier that evening, useful in avoiding detec- tion. He would tell Allan later than he should not have taken the card. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bust,\'94 Allan moaned. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Jo took the four chips from Allan\'92s position and deposited them in the chip tray. She flipped over her down card to reveal the ten of Hearts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sixteen.\'94 For whoever is counting, this was the third lousy total of sixteen that had been played that hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Jo dealt herself the eight of Clubs.\uc0\u8232 \'93Dealer busts.\'94\u8232 She stared at Oakley with a blank expression. Allan stared at Oakley with 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a smirk on his face. Vivian stared at Oakley, shaking with silent laughter. He had just pocketed $900, cash. That was more than his beginning $7000 annual salary would generate in more than a month and a half. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They weren\'92t aware of the spy cameras in the ceiling peering at them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The deck was still \'93hot,\'94 the high-low index being +10/28 \'d7 100, or about +35, and, having established this betting pattern, Oakley continued to place bets larger than the minimum. In the one deck he made up his $1700 in losses at Harold\'92s Club. 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley knew that winning that amount of money in one deck, let alone one hand, wouldn\'92t be duplicated soon and accordingly decided to take a break. He had experienced what he would experience many times over, mod- erately heavy losing streaks, followed by dazzlingly brilliant streaks of large winning hands. This had taught him an important lesson. He could not allow himself to be discouraged by the losses to the extent that he lost faith in the system and either lost discipline and stopped obeying its directives or, even more unconscionably, abandoned playing. In addition, suddenly decreasing his bets to the minimum would tip off the casino, at least Elroy, that he might have a viable system. It was time to take a break. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He and Allan stood up from the table and, with Vivian, Joan, and Manny, they left the table and walked out of the corridor into Harold\'92s lobby. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93My linear operator!\'94 exclaimed Vivian, giving her suddenly wealthy hus- band a hug. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Not bad for five or ten minutes work,\'94 added Allan. \'93A few more hands like that and they\'92ll have to give you tenure,\'94 he joked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah, but now you gotta be careful,\'94 said Manny, stating the obvious. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 agreed Oakley. That kind of action is exactly what draws casino attention. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Look, I think I better not go on the rounds with you no more,\'94 advised Manny. \'93They know my face. Right now you\'92re just a kid looking for a lounge act. I\'92ll just wait outside.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I think that\'92s right,\'94 agreed Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93By the way,\'94 Joan wondered, \'93anyone seen Julian and Nancy?\'94\u8232 \'93Probably taking a dancing lesson,\'94 suggested Manny, smiling. \'93Horizontal 
\fs24 \

\fs32 mambo or something.\'94\uc0\u8232 Vivian had seen Manny trying to pull Nancy toward him when they were 
\fs24 \

\fs32 dancing in the Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge. She didn\'92t appreciate the sexual reference and glared at Manny. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ll call their room,\'94 she said coldly. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, Vivian, and Joan decided to get a celebratory snack, but Allan, although he wasn\'92t playing the point count system, wanted to continue play- ing. He had perhaps gotten the bug. He had, in fact, gotten the bug to such an extent that he would himself eventually author a book on gambling. Oakley told him to avoid Harold\'92s, so Allan went down the street to the Cal Neva. After about an hour they met in Oakley\'92s room at the Mapes Hotel. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan had been playing blackjack and had an interesting tale to tell his friends. The pit boss and dealer were discussing some guy who had carried what they called a magic slot machine. He always wore a white turtleneck with a gold chain around his neck, which he said was for \'93good luck.\'94 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 147 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 In any case, Allan\'92s eavesdropping allowed him to fill in the story of the guy with the turtleneck and gold chain. It seems he had gotten a little plastic toy slot machine as a souvenir welcome gift at the Westward Ho motel in Las Vegas years earlier. The toy was actually operational with a functional handle and all the fruit symbols on three separate wheels. Apparently, he would spin the toy slot machine handle and show the result to everyone at the table. If the three columns of fruit came up all cherries he would bet. Otherwise, he would not. The guy, who liked to be called Goose, would win an uncanny number of hands when he bet. When he lay out, the other players would more often than not lose. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Goose, according to Allan\'92s understanding, quickly attained cult status. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At the Four Queens downtown a couple years earlier, Goose almost lost the toy slot. For four straight deals everyone lost, but Goose had lain out. On the next hand, Goose pulled the slot machine handle, showed it was all cher- ries, laid down a $100 bill and got blackjack. The guy sitting next to him got enraged and grabbed for the toy slot, saying, \'93Let me see that slot machine.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Generally, if you sit you have to play. If you don\'92t want to bet, protocol states that you should leave the table and give up your seat to someone else. The dealers usually enforce this, though gently. Here, though, was a guy with a good luck gold chain and a seemingly cosmically connected magical toy, and the dealers and pit bosses were as intrigued by it as much as anyone else and they let him play. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Later, walking across Virginia Street, Allan related that he saw a guy wear- ing a white turtleneck with a gold chain around his neck. On a whim, he asked the guy if his name was Goose. The man was surprised at this question, according to Allan, but admitted he was the same. Goose wanted to know if Allan worked for one of the casinos, and Allan told him that he was a math- ematician and that he and another mathematician were testing out a system for blackjack. This apparently opened the figurative floodgates of verbiage, because Goose admitted that he was an electrical engineer, with a bachelors\'92 and masters\'92 degree in the difficult VI-2 honors program from, of all places, MIT, and that he, too, had a system. It called for lying out when the deck favored the house and betting heavily when it favored the player. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan asked him about the magic slot machine. He related, with some enthusiasm, as if years had gone by without his being able to share the infor- mation, that he had discovered while playing with the slot machine that the slot machine was defective. If he pressed in slightly on the two sides of the toy slot with his thumb and index finger, it would come up a winning three cherries. Without that pressure, the slot would come up other, random, non- winning fruity combinations.

\fs32 \cf3 Just like Allan and Oakley were camouflaging their play by pretending to be musicians, as Manny had suggested, Goose was camouflaging his play. He would sit at the table and pull the lever. When the deck was cold, he wouldn\'92t press in the sides, random fruit would appear, he\'92d display it to the dealer and the other players, and would not bet. Goose had a perfectly rational excuse. \'93It\'92s bad luck unless the cherries come up,\'94 he would say. When the deck was hot, Goose would pull the lever, push in the sides of the magic slot machine, and display for all to see that the machine god had decreed that he lay down a bet. He would nearly always win when the magic slot machine came up cher- ries, and the other players would usually lose when it did not. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan remembered that Clive, the pit boss at Harold\'92s Club, had men- tioned that the gambler who called himself the Stargazer used a similar device. On mentioning this to Goose, Goose laughed and admitted that the Stargazer was in fact his twin brother and that a couple years earlier they had traveled through Nevada, gambling together in Reno, South Lake Tahoe, Vegas, and Carson City. Goose took the magic slot machine with him on every gambling trip. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan\'92s narrative, in fact, emboldened Oakley. Here was a guy, by all evi- dence, genuine, who had a system enabling him to distinguish cold from hot decks. It was essentially what he and Julian Braun had developed. He would have loved to have met Goose and to have compared systems, but that was the last time any of them encountered him. Perhaps Goose, on reconsidera- tion, had thought Allan was in fact lying and was indeed a casino employee, and that it was best to leave town before either his photograph was taken for dissemination, which would ruin his game for the future, or he was barred or even arrested for breathing too much air or walking on the wrong side of the street.

\fs32 Before the proliferation of relatively low cost television monitors and switching circuits driven by computer software, the tables and slot machines were monitored by personnel in the rooms in the ceiling above the casino floor, the security office. They\'92d be seated in front of closed-circuit television monitors, each person monitoring a few screens. The images were captured by security cameras sitting behind one-way mirrors in the ceilings of casi- nos. Some referred to them as eyes in the sky. Today, the security rooms can be located anywhere in the building, wiring being able to carry the signals anywhere.

\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 These surveillance systems and the monitoring personnel paid for themselves many times over. They would look for cheaters, both players and dealers in cahoots with players. The personnel, most of whom were former dealers and perhaps former pit bosses, knew the kinds of signals between dealers and players used. They particularly paid attention to high rollers. A gambler betting $500 or more a hand could pick up thousands of dollars on a hot streak, and the casino wanted to make sure that in such circumstances only luck was involved. They\'92d look for the player marking cards, either by bending them or putting foreign substances on their backs. They\'92d look for players repeatedly taking hits when they should have stood or standing when they should have taken a card, both indicating that the dealer was peaking at the next card to be dealt and providing the drawing or standing advice to the player. It was a continual game of spy versus spy, the cheating players and the casino trying to stay abreast of each other\'92s techniques. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Sometimes, if a player had won some significant money, the dealer would go upstairs and sit and watch after his shift change. If the player reappeared on another shift, and that dealer was in the casino, he may be called to go upstairs and observe again. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Slot machine players would also be observed. Although historically mechan- ical devices, more and more were electronic, and these could potentially face tampering by a sophisticated cheat. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Generally, however, life in the sky couldn\'92t be more boring. Most players are unsophisticated. This is particularly true in Reno, which lacks the glitz and high rollers of Las Vegas and the romance and well-heeled skiing clientele of South Lake Tahoe. Reno attracts the unfortunate fringe, who can stay in cheap rooming houses or hotels while trying to make a few bucks in the casi- nos. Except for the occasional spilled drink or cigarette burn on the green felt, they create little problems in the casinos. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The security personnel would look at the cameras, finding nothing, and munch on doughnuts and pretzels, with a sip of soft drink or coffee. Because of the nature of their work, and its potential importance, booze was not allowed in the security rooms. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If something out of the ordinary were occurring, the security man would call down to the pit using phones sitting on tables next to the closed-circuit television monitors. Today something out of the ordinary was occurring. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A middle-aged man sat before a couple of the monitors, a blank stare on his face. He munched on a cinnamon roll. He picked up the phone and dialed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The phone on Elroy\'92s table rang. Elroy reluctantly left the dealer with whom he was chatting, and picked up the phone.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yeah?\'94 he knew who was calling. The only calls he would get on that phone were from in the ceiling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What was that about?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Elroy. \'93This kid presented some tokes from Bernie Kurtzman and he got lucky.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bernie Kurtzman?\'94 queried the man upstairs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. I checked. This guy and his girlfriend have a lounge act, and they played some tunes for Bernie to get a gig in the Pair O\'92 Dice. Sounds okay to me.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Who was the pal?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Said he\'92s the manager for the act. I don\'92t know. Sounds okay. Just lucky. They were playing this afternoon and didn\'92t know what the hell they were doing.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The man upstairs was tired of the responses he was getting from Elroy. His job was to keep these types of people off the tables, but he couldn\'92t do it with- out the assistance of the pit bosses. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The guy pocketed nearly $2000 betting, what, only twenty-five dollars?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. He was losing steadily for an hour or two then he jumped it to three hundred.\'94 Elroy was trying to defuse his supervisor by mentioning the higher level bets. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93He made it all up in one damn deck, Elroy.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, I don\'92t know. He was lucky.\'94\u8232 \'93And what the hell was Manny Kimmel doing there?\'94 He wanted informa-

\fs32 tion and was getting nothing he didn\'92t already know, even though he and Elroy had worked together for so long they shared each other\'92s vulgar expressions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Elroy. If the man upstairs hadn\'92t worked with Elroy for more than ten years he might have thought he was working with these guys. \'93Didn\'92t talk to anybody. Just watching maybe. You got this guy\'92s picture?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92ll be on the street in ten minutes,\'94 the man upstairs replied. He knew that Elroy knew the procedure and he thought the question wasn\'92t even worth asking. \'93And a couple of the guys are gonna follow him around.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 Reunited, the four decided to go back to the Riverside Hotel, where they had had dinner, to continue the experiment. No one there had seen Oakley play, either as a rube or as a serious player. It was now nearly 9:00 p.m. Manny had joined them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had been able to find an empty table, which was somewhat sur- prising. Most of the tables were full, as expected at this time of evening. This most likely meant that the players had been losing there, dissuading

\fs32 \cf3 others from sitting. Unless the dealer was actually cheating, or the deck was marked, two highly improbable situations, the empty table was another symptom of players\'92 ignorance. They may have thought the dealer, the table, or the deck of cards was unlucky. As Oakley would repeat numerous times, except for the occasional slight rule variations, the game is the same at every table at every casino. It\'92s a good lesson to learn just in case you do run across a marked deck or dealer cheating in any of the ways that Manny had described. Try to get your money back at another table. Don\'92t chase your money, as the gamblers say. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian, Allan, and Joan stood behind the table. Manny stood off to the side. Allan did not recoup his loss at Harold\'92s Club, and Oakley would play alone. He had started out betting $20 minimum bets, and after winning sev- eral hundred dollars over an hour, he increased his minimum bet to $25, with a maximum of $250. That wouldn\'92t draw attention, he thought. Oakley then started betting at two positions on the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had bet $75, three $25 chips, at each of the two positions. Playing two hands is not uncommon, but it was another bad decision if Oakley wanted to hide that he was a player with some sophistication. They had played two hands, and thirty-three cards remained in the deck, excluding the unseen burned card. The point count before the deal had been +2, providing a high- low index of +2/33 \'d7 100, or +6. He had accordingly laid down the three unit bets, half the high-low index, $25 being his unit, minimum bet. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s hands consisted of the ten of Spades and six of Spades, and the nine of Clubs and seven of Diamonds, both totals equaling the dreaded 16. The up-card of the dealer, a young man named Wally, about the age of our group, his straw-colored blonde hair styled into a precise flattop, was the eight of Hearts. The point values of the two Spades canceled each other out, and the two cards in Oakley\'92s second hand and Wally\'92s card all had point values of zero, so that the point count remained at +2. The high-low index was now +2/28 \'d7 100, or about +7. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The complete point count drawing and standing table directed the player to stand with a total of 16 against the dealer\'92s 8 if the high-low index exceeded +11. It didn\'92t, and Oakley had accordingly asked for a card. The dealer dealt the four of Hearts to the ten of Spades and six of Spades. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stand,\'94 said Oakley. He now held a standing hand of twenty. The point count was +3, and one more card had been played, yielding a high-low index of +3/27 \'d7 100, or about +11. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Actually, the high-low index was slightly more than +11 because 1/9 equals 1.1 to one decimal point. This is how Oakley thought, although he knew it was usually an unwarranted increase in precision relative to the tables he had 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf3 152

\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 devised for playing the system. This case was an exception, +11.1 exceeding the high-low index decision value of +11 for determining his strategy for play- ing his second hand of sixteen. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Wally pointed to the nine of Clubs and seven of Diamonds.\uc0\u8232 \'93Stand,\'94 said Oakley, using the knowledge of that decimal place.\u8232 \'93You got a sixteen there, too, you know,\'94 Wally said.\u8232 \'93I know.\'94\u8232 \'93Strange,\'94 murmured Wally.\u8232 \'93I just don\'92t feel as lucky with this one,\'94 said Oakley.\u8232 Wally flipped over his bottom card to reveal the seven of Clubs.\u8232 \'93Fifteen.\'94\u8232 He dealt himself the eight of Diamonds.\u8232 \'93Dealer busts,\'94 he announced. \'93You guessed right.\'94\u8232 \'93Luck,\'94 Oakley smiled. Oakley would remember this hand. Not only did 
\fs24 \

\fs32 he win $150, but the hand had also provided an interesting conundrum. If the pit boss or man in the sky would ever become skilled in the complete point count system, then he would realize Oakley was changing the point count on the fly, adjusting it as every card was dealt and seen, using, as I said, what he referred to as the running count. That would indicate he was a sophisticated player and must be barred. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On the other hand, the inconsistency in dealing with two hands both total- ing sixteen, taking a hit on one and standing on the other, might indicate, as it did to the dealer here, that the player was basing his decisions on \'93feeling,\'94 \'93luck,\'94 or some superstition. At this point in his career, so to speak, with vir- tually no one except him, Julian, Harvey Dubner, Allan, and Manny aware of either the complete point count or hi-lo systems, he had appeared as a player feeling lucky or unlucky. The future might resolve the casino\'92s conundrum in the opposite way. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As far as luck was concerned, Oakley knew that players following his sys- tem would be considerably \'93luckier\'94 than the average player. They might be embarrassingly lucky. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Wally gathered up the cards from the table as Oakley now laid down six $25 chips at each of the two positions, doubling his previous bet. Seven of the last eight cards dealt had been non-tens, and the deck had become more favorable. The point count was +3, and 26 cards were left in the deck after Wally had busted, yielding a value of the high-low index of + 3/26 \'d7 100, or about +12. That called for a six-unit bet of $150 at each position 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Although Oakley might have been concerned about doubling his bet, in fact he had discovered that casino personnel weren\'92t particularly alarmed at such a strategy. One of the best known \'93systems\'94 for many gambling games is 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf3 15 Toy Slot Machines and Other Diversions 
\fs26\fsmilli13333 153 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 the Small Martingale, also known as the \'93doubling-up\'94 system. In it, a player doubles his bet each time he loses. When he eventually wins, he has made up all his losing bets plus his initial bet. He then reduces his bet to his minimum. In this way, say the player loses bets of $1, $2, $4, and $8, but then wins his bet of $16. He has lost a total of $15 on the first four bets, but then cashed in, netting $1. The system earns its popularity from its simplicity and apparent inability to go wrong. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The system fails because houses have maximum bet limits. For a club with a $300 maximum bet, if your initial bet is $20, for example, you need only lose four times in a row, totaling $20 + $40 + $80 + $160 = $300, to reach a level which you cannot both make up your losses and also earn a profit, the $320 bet being disallowed. Even in an even-money game, such as flipping a fair coin, the probability of getting four losses in a row equals 1/2 multiplied by itself four times, 1/16, equivalent to 6%, and no casino game is an even money game. In a real casino game, the probability of stringing four losses in a row is greater. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Worse than that, the Small Martingale provides a bad strategy for deter- mining your blackjack bet size. When the deck favors the player, he or she should be increasing the bet and when the deck favors the house the player should decrease the bet to a minimum, the unit bet. If the player faces a favorable deck, it may result in a succession of winning hands. It makes little sense, other than if some camouflage technique is being used, to decrease the bet to the minimum. Yet, that is what the Small Martingale system dictates. Similarly, if the player has lost a number of hands in a row, it may indicate that the deck favors the house. Again, it makes little sense to be increasing the bet in such circumstances. Yet, that is what the Small Martingale system dictates. The Small Martingale system tells you to increase your bet when the deck may be against you. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 This may be an occasional good camouflage, as I said, particularly if a casino employee in the sky suspects you are a card counter and is count- ing along with you. Generally, it violates a basic premise of systems such as Oakley\'92s complete point count system. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nonetheless, the system, particularly for players placing small bets at casinos with large maximum bet limits, is popular and, more importantly, easily detectable and well-known to casino personnel as being unsuc- cessful. Oakley, by doubling his bet after winning, was employing what seemed to be a variation on the Small Martingale system. It was a method of camouflage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan was aware of Oakley\'92s ploy and decided to support his efforts by writ- ing a script and engaging Vivian and Joan as well as Oakley in its creation.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93That\'92s the Small Martingale system that he\'92s using,\'94 said Allan. Oakley turned to look at him, but said nothing, indicating that he did not disapprove of Allan\'92s foray. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This system is ancient, truly ancient,\'94 declared Allan, demonstrating for the first time to all of his friends that he was a gambling history buff. \'93What was to become known as the Small Martingale was created by Pierre Gronk and Francois Klunk, the famous Cro-Magnon casino magnates,\'94 he lectured. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 To this unanticipated imaginative invention Oakley emitted a deep laugh, knowing that his friend was for some unknown additional reason, perhaps boredom, creating a very tall tale. Oakley continued the narrative. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yes, what Allan says is right. Although my colleague Claude Shannon invented the wheel, Messieurs Gronk and Klunk made their fortune in the wheel business and indeed constructed the first roulette wheel. Its image appears as a cave painting in the prehistoric Cave du Dublecero in southern France.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s right,\'94 said Allan. \'93Of course, roulette 40,000 years ago was simpler because man then could only count to five, the number of fingers on one hand. The other hand was used in walking.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 To this bizarre visualization they all laughed heartily, including Wally the dealer, his flattop hair shaking from front to back like a straw broom. \'93They developed the Small Martingale system, but they didn\'92t call it the Small Martingale because language hadn\'92t been developed yet, right Wally?\'94 added the well-known linguist Oakley, to additional laughter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right,\'94 agreed Allan. \'93They called it the Gronk-Klunk.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Makes sense to me,\'94 said Joan. \'93We are truly blessed to be in the presence of such scholars, aren\'92t we, Vivian?\'94 said Joan in mock admiration. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure, fascinating archaeological history,\'94 agreed Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Hopefully Wally felt like one of the gang and would cooperate with Oakley\'92s betting pattern. One could be sure that such entertainment was not common at the tables. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Smiling, Wally dealt two cards to each of Oakley\'92s $150 bets and two cards to himself. His up-card was a six of Hearts. Oakley had been dealt a five of Diamonds and seven of Hearts and an eight of Clubs and ten of Diamonds. With five more cards dealt and seen and the point count now at +4, the high- low index was +4/21 \'d7 100, or about +20, telling Oakley to stand pat with both hands against the dealer\'92s 6. The drawing and standing table directs the player to stand with a 12 against the dealer\'92s 6. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Wally flipped over his down card to reveal a Queen of Spades, and he drew a six of Clubs, busting. Oakley made another $300 bet. The high-low index was +4/19 \'d7 100, or still about +20. The complete point count system called

\fs32 \cf3 for a ten-unit, or $250 bet. He left the six $25 chips that he had won on both hands next to his two original $150 bets. He was going to, in the spirit of the \'93reverse\'94 Small Martingale camouflage, \'93let it ride.\'94 It meant a twelve-unit bet instead of the system-directed ten-unit bet, but it was a good camouflage, he thought. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Let it ride,\'94 he accordingly said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Wally dealt two cards to each position and two cards to himself, but before Oakley could pick up his cards the pit boss walked over. He pushed Oakley\'92s chips back to Oakley and held a photograph next to Oakley\'92s face. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You take pretty pictures,\'94 said the pit boss. He was not smiling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley looked at the photograph. It had been taken at a very skewed angle, the result of the camera being in the ceiling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And that\'92s without make-up.\'94 Oakley was shocked but after a swallow had managed to regain his smart-aleck swagger. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Funny,\'94 said the pit boss with false admiration. \'93We don\'92t want your action here.\'94 He really didn\'92t know why this fellow was doing so well, but the report from Harold\'92s Club and his running up almost $500 in less than a quarter of an hour at his casino was enough to get him removed. The \'93reverse\'94 Small Martingale camouflage hadn\'92t worked, Cro-Magnon inspired entertainment or not. Oakley was beginning to learn not to use a large range of bet sizes, no matter what camouflage he was using. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Casinos are basically private Clubs. As you enter any casino, a large sign prominently displayed somewhere on the wall informs you that the casino can remove players at their discretion, for any reason. Winning a lot of money is a reason. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The pit boss waved to two men who quickly walked up behind Oakley, grabbed him by the arm, and yanked him up from the table, pushing aside his shaking wife and bewildered friends. Manny had skulked away when he saw the goons approach. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Next time,\'94 the pit boss continued, then he thought again. \'93But there ain\'92t gonna be a next time, right?\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93And Marie Curie died of cancer resulting from studying radium,\'94 chimed in Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian ignored him and addressed her husband. \'93But you don\'92t have to do this. You\'92re living in Massachusetts writing computer programs!\'94 She pulled a piece of paper out of her purse. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And here\'92s a message left by Julian for us at the hotel. They checked out.\'94 She handed it to Allan \'93Here, Allan, read.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan read the note. \'93Dear Dr. Thorp. Nancy and I are going home. Tell your friend Kimmel, quote, no, Nancy won\'92t accept his invitation to visit him in his room. Yours, Julian.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You think that\'92s funny, too, Allan?\'94 asked Vivian in a mixture of anger and sarcasm. Edward? I don\'92t think it\'92s funny.\'94 She was upset at Manny\'92s treat- ment of Nancy and his disrespect for Julian, but that was all in the substantial context of her concern for Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny responded. \'93What\'92s that about? The guy\'92s nuts. I think I was going to show them how to do some dancing, that\'92s all.\'94 Then he turned to Oakley. \'93Look, we got more important stuff to worry about. Your mug shot, it\'92s all

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93How about a real disguise?\'94 Allan suggested. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You mean Edward Thorp dressed up like Groucho Marx?\'94 asked an intrigued Oakley. \'93Nose, glasses.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, how about Charlie Chan Thorp?\'94 said Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93No, how about this is all over?\'94 said Vivian. She wanted the experiment ter- minated, and now it looked like they were simply going to try another strategy. \'93This might be fun, Vivian,\'94 said Joan, not really empathizing with Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 he does the make-up for the showgirls at Harrah\'92s. Tomorrow. We do this.\'94 \'93You\'92re really serious,\'94 said Oakley. He was becoming more than simply intrigued by the concept. They had become sufficiently indoctrinated in tech- niques of camouflage, the booze hounds, the magic slot machine, the starving musicians coming for an audition, and the playing worthless common sys- tems such as do-not-bust and the Small Martingale to believe that an actual 
\fs24 \

\fs32 make-up camouflage might be advantageous.\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s in the name of science, Charlie,\'94 said Allan, casting his vote for Charlie

\fs32 \cf3 The dressing room for the showgirls at Harrah\'92s shared the opulence of the high-roller suites and the showrooms themselves. A hardwood table covered with a Formica veneer ran along the rose-patterned red wallpapered wall. It had red felt highlights. A mirror hung on the wall behind the table. Above the table were evenly spaced spherical light bulbs encased in metal housing. Cushioned mesh-backed chairs stood in front of the table. A refrigerator was stuffed with snacks and fruit and soft drinks. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Make-up kits, packages of plastic molding compound, and wire rim glasses lay on a make-up table, out of place except for the job at hand. Manny had purchased the wire rim glasses the afternoon after Oakley was banned from the Riverside Hotel. It was about 7:00 p.m. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Showgirls were walking by in various states of costume. Oakley sat in one chair facing the mirror. Allan and Manny stood behind him. Jeffrey Lyle Segal, a well-known Hollywood, Las Vegas, and Reno make-up artist, stood to Oakley\'92s side. He examined Oakley\'92s face. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You know you have a perfect oval head,\'94 said Jeffrey.\uc0\u8232 \'93Versus an imperfect oval head?\'94 asked Oakley, bemused.\u8232 \'93I see round heads, flat heads, square heads. But the oval is the perfection 
\fs24 \

\fs32 of beauty,\'94 said Jeffrey.\uc0\u8232 \'93You should\'92a been a showgirl, Thorp,\'94 said Manny.\u8232 About an hour later, the project was supposedly progressing. Oakley\'92s face 
\fs24 \

\fs32 was covered with a shapeless plastic gel. Jeffrey wore plastic gloves,\'94 full of the gooey material.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93You\'92ve done this before, right?\'94 said Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93No,\'94 responded Jeffrey.\u8232 A showgirl walked by and stared at Oakley.\u8232 \'93Hi, handsome!\'94 she exclaimed. \'93Wanna party with us?\'94 She was probably 
\fs24 \

\fs32 simply being supportive. The girls who had showgirl jobs at Harrah\'92s were at the top of their so-called profession. They had formal dance training, were good athletes, and had to be, in addition, as one might expect, tall, trim, leggy, curvy, and possess perfect teeth and complexion and a glowing smile. Any tricks or even minor dalliances with the patrons was prohibited. They had no personality defects that would have led to mean spiritedness. This particular gal probably had been made up many times by Jeffrey Segal and she knew him to be skillful, no matter the present monstrous appearance of Oakley\'92s face. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See?\'94 said Jeffrey to Oakley. \'93Don\'92t question the make-up man.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny threw in his two cents. \'93Yeah. Tell the dealer you wanna party with the showgirls. That\'92s another camouflage.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s shapeless plastic physiognomy had transformed within another hour to one with Oriental features. He wore a thin moustache and wire rim glasses. Jeffrey held a black goatee in his hand as another showgirl walked by on her way to the stage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Finally,\'94 Jeffrey announced, \'93two dollars and ninety-eight cents.\'94 He applied the goatee to Oakley\'92s chin. Oakley, Allan, and Manny, who had been present during the entire transformation, joined Jeffrey in staring at Oakley\'92s image in the mirror. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If I didn\'92t know it was you, I wouldn\'92t know it was you,\'94 observed Allan. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley responded in a moderately good Chinese accent, \'93You talk velly funny.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93See,\'94 said Manny. \'93My 
\f2\i lantzman 
\f1\i0 friend Jeffrey Lyle Segal, he\'92s the best. Nobody\'92ll know it\'92s you. Guaranteed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Although his transformation was impressive, Oakley decided to avoid the Riverside and Harold\'92s, from which he had been removed, to put it politely. He decided just to walk out of the dressing room at Harrah\'92s through the showroom and lobby and into the casino. To avoid suspicion, his entourage would be left behind. He would be trying the complete point count system alone for the first time. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He sat down at an empty table. The dealer had the deck splayed out over the table and ran his hand above it as Oakley placed two $5 chips that he still had in his pocket from the experience at the Riverside Hotel in his betting square. The pit boss watched. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Just in on the chicken soup express from San Francisco?\'94 the dealer asked. \'93What?\'94 asked Charlie Chan.\uc0\u8232 \'93The chicken soup express. Didn\'92t you come in on the bus with the rest 
\fs24 \

\fs32 from Chinatown?\'94 the dealer replied.\uc0\u8232 \'93Oh, right,\'94 Oakley, said trying for an Oriental accent. \'93I had hot and sour 
\fs24 \

\fs32 soup.\'94\uc0\u8232 The pit boss walked over and, to Oakley\'92s dismay, pushed Oakley\'92s chips 
\fs24 \

\fs32 back to Oakley. He held a photograph next to Oakley\'92s face.\uc0\u8232 \'93Well, look at this,\'94 said the pit boss in mock amazement. \'93If it isn\'92t our pro- fessor dressed up like a Chinaman. Guess you don\'92t know how to take advice.\'94 This guy was not happy that he and his pit were the next intended victims. He must have taken it personally. Oakley realized he at least should not have played the chips from the Riverside Hotel. Although players do play what are referred to as \'93foreign chips,\'94 Oakley should have bought new chips at Harrah\'92s with cash to use at Harrah\'92s tables. The pit boss grabbed Oakley\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 cheek and ripped off part of the disguise. He shoved it into Oakley\'92s face. \'93Here,\'94 said the pit boss. \'93It\'92s lunchtime. Take the rest off. Now.\'94 He 
\fs24 \

\fs32 pointed across the room to the bathrooms. \'93There\'92s a bathroom.\'94\uc0\u8232 After Oakley entered the men\'92s room, several brawny men in overalls approached it. One of them placed a placard on the door handle which read \'93Bathroom Closed for Cleaning\'94 and stood by the door. He had carried a large portable radio with him and now turned it on high. Two other atten- dants entered the bathroom. They carried neither mops nor bottles of cleaning 
\fs24 \

\fs32 material.\uc0\u8232 Two men, no doubt being told that the bathroom was being closed for 
\fs24 \

\fs32 cleaning, exited the bathroom. Oakley, who had just entered, did not exit with them. Despite the loud music, a careful listener standing near the bathroom would have heard muffled thuds and thumps competing with the music. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After only a minute, a very short time in which to fully clean a large hotel bathroom, even if fully equipped with cleaning material and state-of-the-art bathroom cleaning technology, the two attendants exited the bathroom. The one standing outside removed the placard and they all walked away.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley lay in his bed at the Mapes Hotel with most of the disguise removed. Cold, damp cloths covered his cheeks and chin. Allan and Manny watched as Joan peeled off the remaining layers of Oakley\'92s facial make-up and fake moustache and Vivian dabbed a cloth over his nose. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This experiment is beginning to make me feel uncomfortable,\'94 Oakley said in a mild understatement. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 His pain and near-death experience, nearly as frightful as that of Vivian\'92s reaction and the pillow, had made him recall a 
\f2\i Tales from the Crypt 
\f1\i0 comic book story he had read as an inquisitive teenager in which a dashing, debonair, heart-throb chemistry professor revealed to his new student-bride in their honeymoon cabin in the Alps the result of various laboratory experiments. Such mishaps as an exploding Bunsen burner, the spilling of nitric acid on his arm, and a careless student mixing sodium with water had left him a pulpy disfigured blob, with most of his appendages as well as face being prosthetic. Oakley wasn\'92t quite in that bad of shape. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At least his marriage was, for the moment, intact, unlike that of the comic book chemistry professor, whose horrified bride retreated to the cabin win- dow and fell to her own ghastly disfigurement. Oakley smiled, remembering the end of the love story. The student survived to be reunited with her profes- sor as a crawling mass of broken flesh, knocking on the cabin door, to soon grapple with the professor on the cabin floor, physical equals, in the consum- mation of their nuptials. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Those gals. Must have talked about the disguise,\'94 Manny guessed, mistak- ing Oakley\'92s smile for a grimace. \'93Big mouths. Casino guy heard \'91em talking. Who knows?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian used the cloth to move Oakley\'92s nose left and right. Oakley\'92s smile quickly dissipated as the pain generated a moan. \'93Sorry,\'94 she said. \'93At least it\'92s not broken.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, I figure the number of hours you\'92ve played with the number of hands you\'92ve gotten each hour, you\'92ve played a couple hundred hands,\'94 said Allan. He had stood on the other side of the room, not wanting to see his friend in pain. \'93That\'92s not enough hands to make the results statistically significant.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian got the message that Allan wanted Oakley to continue playing, nearly broken nose or not. \'93Allan, will you look at his face?\'94 she exclaimed in disbelief. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Allan, maybe she\'92s right,\'94 Oakley acceded. The stress on Vivian, the alienation of his colleague and friend Julian Braun, the difficulty he had experienced in being able to play long enough to make good money, and now this physical assault, something he had never really suffered growing up in Chicago, may have changed his mind, need to prove himself or not. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Maybe they\'92re all damn right. It works in principle. Maybe in the real life of the casino . . .\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bull, Edward,\'94 said Allan, getting as close to swearing as he ever would. Allan Wilson was a skilled mathematician with an interest in games of chance just as Oakley was. He had obtained his Ph. D. at Berkeley before moving to L.A. to take the post
\f0\b -
\f1\b0 doctoral appointment at UCLA. He knew that this technique had to eventually work. It was just a matter of learning the correct etiquette, managing your money, letting the law of large numbers work its magic, and adopting effective camouflage. \'93You know that\'92s stupid.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny provided some important tips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Your problem, Thorp,\'94 he said, \'93is you\'92re betting too high when the deck gets hot. Tipping \'91em off. Might as well wear a neon sign on your head. Just lower your big bets.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan moved closer to Oakley\'92s bed. Manny Kimmel was providing advice from the years of experience that they lacked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And for cryin\'92 out loud, ya\'92 told me you used chips from Riverside at Harrah\'92s. Stupid. Never play foreign chips. They check between casinos, ya\'92 know? And, damn it, when you\'92ve won a big bet leave the table. Don\'92t let them examine your play too much. Pretend you\'92re a kid on a paper route. Collect a little here, collect a little there. You\'92ll be okay from here on in.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Here on in?\'94 Vivian cried. It seemed to her that she was being outvoted by men who couldn\'92t care about her husband\'92s shoulder, nose, or health in general. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I only got $2500 of profit. I didn\'92t fly out here for $2500 of profit,\'94 said Manny. Then, to use the trick he had employed when visiting Oakley and Julian in Brookline, he went into gangster threat mode. \'93My investor friends. They won\'92t be too happy.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was in an unenviable position. Play, and the house goons beat you up. Don\'92t play, and Manny Kimmel\'92s guys might come up from New Jersey and, well, he didn\'92t want to think about it. He certainly didn\'92t want to become the protagonist in a story in 
\f2\i Tales From the Crypt. 
\f1\i0\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan knew the situation. \'93When are you due back at school?\'94 he asked Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Careful!\'94 screamed Oakley at Vivian. Maybe she had tweaked his nose on purpose to remind him of the pain, or maybe she just stiffened up and trans- mitted that squeeze on hearing Allan\'92s question and its implication. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92ve still got ten days,\'94 answered Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93We gotta get back tomorrow,\'94 reported Allan.\u8232 \'93Then you and me, Thorp, we go to Tahoe,\'94 said Manny. \'93Too much cheat-

Maybe he had already made up his mind 
\fs24 \

\fs32 to go to Tahoe and was just mollifying Vivian. Maybe he had decided to give up, although anyone who knew Oakley, including Vivian, doubted it. He was too competitive. \'93The playing is over here. They know my face.\'94

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I have to, Vivian. We need more statistics. You know I have to.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley would have preferred playing heads-up against the dealer, but at 9:00 p.m. he was happy to have found a table where only two others were playing. It had taken him and Manny, and the girls, about an hour to drive the sixty miles south on Highway 395 from Reno, and Oakley was eager to gamble. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 During the ride Oakley and Manny discussed what he had seen and learned. Oakley had observed the dealers staring at his eyes as he counted the cards. He learned quickly to use his excellent peripheral vision, looking anywhere but toward the cards as either players busted or the dealer scooped them up after all hands had been played. He also had to find a way to count rapidly. He found that it was quicker and easier just to cancel out images pair wise, a deuce can- celing a face card, for example, than laboriously adding plus and minus ones. In this way the point count could be adjusted by simply adding or subtracting the remainder, usually of an absolute value no greater than two or three. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley, who had learned the power of the right mode of brain processing as a Cornell student preparing for exams, thus realized that he could use the right mode of brain processing to count the cards. He could count more quickly by holistically viewing the images of the cards rather than using the analytical, left mode of brain processing, that is, the sequential counting of them by adding and subtracting plus and minus ones.

\fs32 \cf3 As a sort of corollary to this, Oakley learned not always to sit in the seventh and last seat at the table, third base. Sitting there certainly provided him an advantage. He could see the cards in the hands of players who had busted, enabling him to keep an updated point count, the running count. If, however, he played for an extended time at one table, or if he revisited that pit on another day, and continued to win, the sitting in third base might indicate to the house that he was using a viable system. This was particularly true if they observed him staring at the cards. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On the other hand, many unsophisticated players believe that the player sitting in third base can control the outcome of the hand, which can result in their becoming the target of hostility. Let\'92s say the dealer has a six showing. If the third-base player takes a hit and gets, say, a face card, the other players who had not busted might get upset, irrationally, that that face card was \'93meant\'94 for the dealer and could have busted the dealer. Many players, to avoid these types of situations, avoid sitting in third base. That Oakley would in fact sit there routinely might, again, indicate to the house that he was not a na\'efve player. It was best, Oakley, learned not to sit in the last seat every ses- sion, despite it providing him valuable information. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On the analytical side, he was now creating a log of his play. On a piece of paper he would write the name of the casino, the time he played, how long he had played, and his winnings or losses. He included a comment column to note extraordinary events, if a mechanic had been put at his table, if the dealer was particularly accommodating by dealing to the very end of the deck, for example, if he had won a significantly large hand, if he had made the attention- attracting move of splitting ten-value cards, and so on. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The log could serve various purposes. Most importantly, he could track his net winnings. They had refined the paper route technique to directing the player to leave a casino after no more than 20 or 25 units of the minimum bet having been won or lost, about four of five times the conservative maximum bet. More than 20 might attract attention. Less than 20 might indicate he had encountered a cheating dealer. Making the limit quantitative would avoid emotional decisions, either greed or wanting to \'93get my money back.\'94 In any case, he would now leave the table after an hour to avoid even a minimum of scrutiny. Of course, Oakley would be free to modify the criteria for staying or leaving a table based on particular circumstances, leaving if, for examples, a mechanic dealer suddenly appeared at his table or he had split tens multiple times on a single hand and won. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The log also enabled Oakley to avoid other modes of generating excessive scrutiny and detection, leading perhaps to getting barred or again slammed up in some men\'92s room. He would avoid playing the same casino during a 
\fs24 \

\fs32 given shift. He would avoid playing a casino where he had done especially well on consecutive days or consecutive shifts. In short, he was realizing that to successfully use his system he had to be not only a good counter and employ camouflage but to be a good, so to speak, businessman. He called it \'93money management.\'94

\fs32 New and refined camouflage techniques had become apparent. Although he had learned early in his playing to avoid large swings in his bets, he had kept the range of bets from one to at most ten units of his minimum bet, a range of $25 to $250 at the Silver Spur, for example. It would be ideal to bet the table maximum when the deck became favorable and reduce it to $1 when the deck became unfavorable, but such extremes would quickly alert the casino if you were winning. After Manny\'92s comments and his experience at the Riverside, he was going to consider limiting his maximum bet to only three, four, or five units of his minimum bet, particularly when a larger bet would put him close to the table maximum. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As additional camouflage, sometimes he would begin a fresh deck with a large bet, reduce his bet when the deck became favorable, and increase it when it became unfavorable. He would do this more frequently when a pit boss was watching. More than once, after such a contrary move, the pit boss would simply walk away, to Oakley\'92s great satisfaction. Again, if he were concerned that his betting and playing strategies might draw attention he would play at tables with one or more high rollers. The attention would be paid to them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had faced at least one cheating dealer, which reinforced his concept that the game is the same, except for some occasional rule variations, at every table at every casino, and not to remain at a table with a cheating dealer to, as I said, \'93get my money back.\'94 Oakley had soon learned that the shifts at a given casino are the same length, typically thirty or forty minutes with a twenty minute break. All the dealers in a given pit would be relieved at the same time. If a dealer suddenly appeared at his table, while the other dealers remained at their tables, it was likely a cheating dealer sent to retrieve the money he had taken from the casino, possibly one of the mechanics that Manny had described at the joyous meeting at the Oakley\'92s in Brookline. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 As a partner in the development of the complete point count system with Dubner and Julian, Oakley had faith in it. Although the number of hands he had played, as Allan had pointed out, was yet insufficient to create statistically significant results, Oakley felt that the complete point count worked and that with a longer run it would be validated and he would win, even enough to make Manny happy. Nonetheless, the frequent losing streaks, which might discourage a normal player and lead him to quit, reminded Oakley to remain dispassionate and focused.

\fs32 \cf3 He had been playing at a table at Harvey\'92s Wagon Wheel with two other players for nearly an hour, betting $25 to $100. He was up about $400, only sixteen units of his unit minimum bet. The high-low index had been negative a disproportionate amount of the time, and the other players, of course not varying their strategy, had been losing steadily. Neither of the paper route technique signals for leaving the table had occurred, and he was confident that little or no attention was being paid to the table, none of the players being particularly successful. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After the dealer shuffled, the other players bet lightly, trying to hold on. The player to the immediate left of the dealer, Darlene, according to her name tag, had bet a single $5 chip, and the player to Oakley\'92s right had bet two $5 chips. He was sitting in third base. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had bet $150, laying down six $25 chips. Although this was the first hand being played out of a freshly shuffled 52-card deck, Oakley had placed a bet of six of his minimum $25 bet as a camouflage technique. He was using the camouflage of avoiding starting each new deck with a minimum bet and then increasing it systematically if the deck became favorable. To his chagrin, he had been dealt the ten of Diamonds and four of Clubs. This was a horrible hand, and he would soon see that the other two players shared the same fate. Nonetheless, Darlene\'92s up-card, the six of Clubs, gave them all hope. Manny stood behind Oakley, watching. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 With three cards played and viewed by Oakley, excluding the unseen burned hole card, 49 cards remained. The point count was +1. The high-low index was therefore +1/49 \'d7 100, or about +2. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Darlene was a cute, sweet, freckled girl, about 22 years old, young for a blackjack dealer. She shared her name with one of approximately, Oakley estimated, 100 million American girls now being named after the cute, sweet, freckled Mouseketeer. She seemed to be enjoying the background piped-in music at Harvey\'92s Wagon Wheel, \'93Get A Job,\'94 a hit tune of 1957 by The Silhouettes, as she dealt. She would bob her head up and down to the tune. If not for her age and obvious lack of experience, the streak of unfavorable decks might have led Oakley to think she was cheating. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She dealt a ten of Hearts to the first player, who immediately turned over the cards he had been dealt, showing them to be the seven of Clubs and eight of Hearts. He busted, but, more importantly to Oakley, he had taken a hit with his total of 15 against the dealer\'92s 6. Oakley thought to himself that such a strategy move violated even Baldwin\'92s basic strategy. Not only did the player, by taking a hit with 15 against the dealer\'92s 6, violate both Baldwin\'92s and his revised basic strategy, many of whose strategy decisions should be intuitively evident to an experienced player, his play was also an egregious violation of 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s complete point count system, of which, of course, the player had no knowledge. The high-low index had been +2, both of the player\'92s cards having a point value of zero, and Oakley\'92s tables for drawing and standing for hard hands said stand if you have a 15 against the dealer\'92s 6 if the high-low index exceeds \uc0\u8722 28. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sorry,\'94 dimpled Darlene told the busted player. She removed his $5 chip from the table and deposited it into her money tray and then scooped up the seven of Clubs, eight of Hearts, and ten of Hearts and placed them in her discard pile. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The player watched and sighed. \'93You\'92re too hot for me, honey.\'94 Oakley nearly gagged as the player left the table. He had a very fleeting urge to tell the guy to read Baldwin\'92s paper. Six cards had been played and viewed, excluding the unseen burned hole card, and 46 cards remained. With Darlene\'92s dealing the ten of Hearts, the point count was now zero, reducing the high-low index to +0/46 \'d7 100, or zero. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The second player scratched the table with his cards, directing Darlene to deal him a card. She dealt him the nine of Diamonds. He, too, busted, flip- ping over his down cards to reveal the nine of Spades and six of Clubs, another fifteen. He, too, Oakley thought, had violated the basic strategy as well as the complete point count. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bust again,\'94 said Darlene. \'93It\'92s the cards.\'94 She probably did feel some compassion for these fellows. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah. The cards,\'94 the player agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Darlene took his two $5 chips and deposited them into her money tray, then scooped up the nine of Spades, six of Clubs, and the nine of Diamonds, and placed them in her discard pile. With three more cards dealt and seen, including the six of Clubs, the point count was, assigning zero to the sevens, eights, and nines, +1 and 43 cards remained to be played. The high-low index was therefore +1/43 \'d7 100, or about +2. Oakley\'92s tables directed him to stand with a 14 against the dealer\'92s 6 if the index exceeded \'9617. If the other two players had been dealt or had drawn a number of ten-value cards or Aces, the index might have gotten that low, but they hadn\'92t been so blessed. Oakley, by sitting in the last chair, had been able to keep a running count, and governed his strategy by this up-to-date count and index. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He waved his hand over his cards, signaling he was standing.\uc0\u8232 \'93Fourteen,\'94 he said, flipping the cards over. \'93Gotta stand.\'94\u8232 Darlene hadn\'92t been dealing for more than a year. If the two other players 
\fs24 \

\fs32 had taken hits with their fifteens, it seemed to her that another player should take a hit with the poorer hand that Oakley held. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You want to stand with a fourteen?\'94 she asked.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Yep,\'94 he said. \'93You\'92re just too hot,\'94 echoing the lingo and sentiments of the other two players, another element of camouflage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Okay,\'94 she said. She flipped over her down card to reveal a Jack of Spades. The count was now zero, with 42 cards remaining to be played. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sixteen.\'94 She dealt herself the King of Diamonds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dealer busts,\'94 she announced. That, of course, would have been Oakley\'92s card, but he had elected to stand. This was not lost on either the second player or Darlene. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She took six $25 chips from her money tray and placed them next to the six $25 chips in front of Oakley. The deck had favored the players during the very first hand. It would continue to do so during the entire deck. Having established his opening bet at $150, Oakley was able to increase his bet to the $300 without attracting attention. In the rest of the deck he made another $1000. Once again, persevering through long periods of moderate losing was rewarded with a burst of stunning wins. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He was now up over $1700 at Darlene\'92s table, betting generally no more than $100 per hand.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 After another half-hour of play, Oakley\'92s winnings oscillated up and down, and he left Harvey\'92s Wagon Wheel up about $2000. The paper route tech- nique dictated that he leave the casino before the pit boss or, more likely, any camera-assisted eyes might detect a pattern in his play. It did not dictate that he leave the table in the middle of a favorable deck. That he had begun that highly successful deck with an increased bet was sufficient camouflage to allow him to stay the additional half an hour. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He and Manny moved the operation to Harrah\'92s. Harrah\'92s, of course, was where he was almost murdered by Vivian. He remembered it fondly. As he entered the casino, he thought that he now had the opportunity not only to get that room rental back, but also to get revenge on their terminating his bachelorhood. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He found a table where only one person was sitting. After an hour of play, he was down about $50. He had been betting at the same level as at Harvey\'92s, between $25 and $250 per hand. Manny had wanted to double his $10,000 stake, and Oakley knew that South Lake Tahoe might be the last gambling location where he had a chance of delivering. He decided to increase his betting range from $50 to $300 and also to sometimes bet at more than one betting 
\fs24 \

\fs32 position. Lady Luck, so to speak, began to favor Oakley. After another hour, he was up over $1500. That was equivalent to 30 units of his minimum bet, and he had been at the same table for two hours, both paper route signals for leaving the table. He decided to remain. He couldn\'92t return until the next shift or even the next day to Harvey\'92s and the number of venues in South Lake Tahoe was limited. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They started a new deck, and Oakley was about even until about 25 cards, half the deck, had been played. The point count was +3 and the high-low index was +3/25 \'d7 100, or about +12. Oakley had bet $300, six of his unit bet of $50, twelve $25 chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley had been dealt the Ace of Clubs and six of Diamonds, for a soft 17. The dealer\'92s up card was the five of Clubs. Only twenty-two cards in the deck or, because of the other player\'92s cards, remained unseen, and the point count was +4. That provided a very favorable high-low index of +4/22 \'d7 100, or about +18. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Some kind of Herb Alpert music was playing in the background. Oakley didn\'92t particularly like the lilting, light, pop style of his Tijuana Brass. He thought of the audition at the Pair-o\'92-Dice Lounge and Bernie Kurtzman\'92s comment about their crowd being a \'93Yellow Rose of Texas\'94 kind. Oakley would have preferred Maynard Ferguson, a jazz trumpet player\'92s trumpet player. The music of Miles Davis would have been too morose for a casino. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The dealer was a woman by the name of, and I am not making this up, Doreen. Perhaps Darlene and Doreen\'92s mothers had met years earlier in a time-warp at a Mickey Mouse Club fan club meeting. Perhaps, Oakley thought, Doreen\'92s mother had skills of precognition. He would have liked to have met her and tested her for such skills. She would have made a valuable blackjack consultant. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The other player scratched the table with his cards, and Doreen dealt him a King of Hearts. He flipped over his two cards, showing the ten of Hearts and six of Spades. He had bet two $10 chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Bust. Sorry,\'94 said Doreen. She removed his cards and chips from the table as Oakley, now in missionary mode, thought he, too, could use a copy of Baldwin\'92s paper. A 16 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5 calls for standing with a high-low index greater than \uc0\u8722 34. The high-low index had been +18, in another arithmeti- cal universe from \u8722 34. If he had been using the complete point count, an impos- sibility of course with Oakley only trying it out for himself, his running count and the calculated high-low index without seeing Oakley\'92s cards would have been the same that Oakley had found, +4 and about +18, respectively. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 With the dealing of the King of Hearts, Oakley\'92s running count resulting from seeing the other player\'92s originally dealt cards was now +3 and the high- low index was +3/19 \'d7 100, or about +16.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley took six $25 chips from his pile and placed them next to the six $25 chips at his position. Manny, standing behind Oakley, gasped quietly. That was a $600 bet on the table. Only at Harold\'92s Club had he had more on the table, but that had included a split. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Double down,\'94 Oakley announced. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You don\'92t double down and ask for a card when you got her beat, pal,\'94 the other player scolded Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Really? Ah. A rookie mistake,\'94 Professor Thorp replied. In fact, with a +16 high-low index, Oakley\'92s complete point count system directed the player to double down with a soft 17 against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5 if the high-low index exceeded \uc0\u8722 28. Professor Thorp knew that +16 was in fact greater than \u8722 28, something I would guess he remembered from third grade, or maybe had discovered for himself while resting from calculating the number of seconds in a year. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Doreen dealt an eight of Clubs next to the Ace of Clubs and six of Diamonds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The other player took a few minutes, it seemed, to tally Oakley\'92s hand. \'93Now you got a rotten fifteen,\'94 he deduced. \'93Some guys don\'92t know diddly about this game,\'94 he told Doreen. Maybe he wanted to date Doreen and was trying to impress the Mousketeer with his acumen. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I stand,\'94 said Oakley looking sheepishly at the player.\uc0\u8232 \'93You only get one card when you double down,\'94 Doreen instructed him. \'93Oh, sorry,\'94 said Oakley as the other player buried his head in his hands in 
\fs24 \

\fs32 disgust. Oakley had learned to make beginner\'92s mistakes every once in a while as a form of camouflage. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Doreen flipped her down card to reveal a Jack of Clubs.\uc0\u8232 \'93Sixteen,\'94 she said. She dealt herself a King of Diamonds.\u8232 \'93Dealer busts.\'94\u8232 Oakley had won $600 on the soft doubling down. He had taken Harrah\'92s 
\fs24 \

\fs32 South Lake Tahoe for nearly $2000. This was a fine gambling mecca, Oakley thought as he got up from the table. Twenty units of a minimum $50 bet was equivalent to $1000. His $2000 indicated that it was more than time to leave this casino according to the paper route technique that he and Manny had refined. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \cf3 Manny and Oakley left Harrah\'92s after, as Manny had directed, cashing out and leaving his chips there. To Manny and his great pleasure, he had won 
\fs24 \

\fs32 $1955. The $2500 he had won in Reno had now increased to almost $6500. A mathematics education is a wonderful thing, Oakley thought as they con- tinued their paper route at Barney\'92s. Madeleine and Renee wanted to tag along, and Oakley thought they would provide good camouflage, two men with their friends partying in Tahoe. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Walking over, Oakley recalled the excursion several years previously when he, Vivian, Allan, and Joan had tried out Baldwin\'92s group\'92s system and had scored some free meal tickets, while encountering the renowned Mr. Marcum. He was sure that, if anyone remembered him, they would do so with a chuckle rather than fear of having Oakley take their money. He went to the cage and bought $2000 in chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 To Oakley\'92s chagrin, country music was the choice of the vice-president in charge of piped-in ambiance. It was quickly dispelled as Oakley spotted a 52-card deck of cards lying spread out neatly in a semi-circle, face-up, on a blackjack table near the entrance to the casino. No player was at the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The dealer, a man about 40 years old, stood with his arms crossed behind the table. A pit boss watched as Oakley and Manny walked up to the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Is this table open?\'94 asked Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sure,\'94 said the dealer. He scooped up the cards as Oakley sat down and placed one $25 chip on each of two betting squares on the table. Manny watched as the dealer dealt two cards face down next to each of Oakley\'92s bet- ting squares and two cards to himself, one face down and one face up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Before Oakley could move his hand to turn over his first hand, the pit boss walked quickly over and placed his hands over the cards. He stared at Oakley. \'93If it isn\'92t the Reno movie star,\'94 the pit boss said, throwing a photograph of 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley on the table over Oakley\'92s chips.\uc0\u8232 Oakley looked at the photograph. \'93The resemblance is uncanny,\'94 he said, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 being, yes, a smart-aleck. Oakley hid his discouragement well.\uc0\u8232 \'93You come back here in your Chinaman outfit, you might find yourself in 
\fs24 \

\fs32 a terrible skiing accident. You understand?\'94\uc0\u8232 Oakley, Manny, Madeleine, and Renee left the casino and sat at a table in 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Barney\'92s coffee shop. Normally, if they had planned on continuing to gamble, they would have gone to a different casino for a snack or a break. It didn\'92t matter who saw them or overheard them now. Oakley\'92s gambling in the entire state was, at least for the time being, apparently over. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93This ain\'92t good,\'94 commented Manny in what was more than a mild understanding. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What\'92s not good, sugar?\'94 asked Madeleine, who apparently hadn\'92t had her fruit for the day.

\fs24 \

\fs32 Renee placed her head on Manny\'92s shoulder.\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah. I got class. Right, Manny?\'94\u8232 Oakley had been listening and thinking, but was as discouraged as Manny. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What do we do, Manny?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s over here,\'94 he said. Then a flash of revelation illuminated his face. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But, you know, they got tables in Puerto Rico, too, you know.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Puerto Rico?\'94 remarked Oakley, taken completely unawares by this sugges- tion. He had never entertained the possibility, and the implication of leaving the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 U. S. mainland was overwhelming. \'93I want to go see my wife,\'94 he said. Manny dismissed the statement with a wave of his hand. \'93I say Puerto 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Rico.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah, honey. Puerto Rico,\'94 said Renee, in a familiarity strange between an 
\fs24 \

\fs32 uncle and niece.\uc0\u8232 \'93I\'92ll be good, sugar,\'94 promised Madeleine, using another perhaps inappropri- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ate term of endearment.\uc0\u8232 Manny essentially ignored them, knowing that persuading Oakley had the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 higher priority. \'93The rules are different. Two decks, and they deal \'91em face up.\'94 \'93That\'92s interesting,\'94 said Oakley. He envisioned being able to take multiple hands and keep a point count that would account for all the cards that had been dealt, rather than just those he had been able to see on the table as they 
\fs24 \

\fs32 were flipped over after a hand was played.\uc0\u8232 \'93They deal from a shoe, so that makes it tougher to cheat. And you can 
\fs24 \

\fs32 only double on eleven,\'94 Manny continued. \'93They got a $50 bet limit, but you can bet all the positions on the table, so it don\'92t matter. And the dealers, they deal much quicker than in Nevada, so you get a lot of action.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s very interesting,\'94 said Oakley. He had considered betting two or maybe three hands, but now Manny Kimmel had told him he could in fact bet all seven positions. If, for example, three-quarters of the 104-card double deck had been played, leaving only 26 cards, he could take seven hands and, counting the dealer\'92s two cards, only ten cards would remain. The point count would give him an excellent idea if they were high-value or low-value cards. He could double down and split to even get down to the very end of the deck. Oakley by this time had had enough experience with the complete point count system to know that what he would call \'93end play" could be exceed- ingly lucrative. It was too enticing to pass up. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92d have to get Julian to program in the differences,\'94 he said to Manny, sold on the Puerto Rico trip. \'93See the effects of the double deck and the 
\fs24 \

\fs32 doubling down only on eleven. It might take a couple weeks. But that would be very interesting.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley realized that playing the complete point count system using a double deck and playing with the severely restricted rules for doubling down would provide a powerful test. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And your picture, it ain\'92t gonna be all over the streets there,\'94 said Manny, sealing a deal that had already been sealed. \'93You don\'92t play stupid down there, you\'92ll be okay.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 said Oakley, remembering the beatings, mild and severe, that he had taken, and beginning to think of palm trees and exotic beaches. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93And you grease the palms a little, they let you play,\'94 said Manny, aware that Oakley had been effectively banned from a number of casinos from Reno to Tahoe, but not aware that Oakley\'92s mind was wandering to foreign shores. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 said Oakley perfunctorily, still considering the scientific, and per- sonal, benefit of successfully trying the system under a different set of rules. After all, success would result in an undeniably total dissipation of the cloud created by his father\'92s disparagement. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley left Manny and his nieces and walked out of the restaurant and over to the bank of phones hanging from the wall in Barney\'92s lobby. He had the hotel operator call Allan\'92s house and asked her to charge the call to his room. As soon as he picked up the phone, Oakley asked him about Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93She\'92s staying with Joan,\'94 replied Allan. \'93They\'92re going to open up that boutique they\'92ve been talking about.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Does she talk about me?\'94 Oakley asked.\uc0\u8232 \'93Does she talk about you? Yeah. All the time. When she\'92s not crying.\'94 \'93Well,\'94 said Oakley. \'93What does she say?\'94\u8232 \'93What does she say? She wants to know if your experiment with Manny 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Kimmel and his nieces is over. . . . Well?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s not over,\'94 Oakley answered. If Oakley indeed had the transcendent, 
\fs24 \

\fs32 supernatural powers that Vivian once ascribed to him, or if he had been less preoccupied with Vivian and more aware of Allan\'92s speech pattern, repeating Oakley\'92s question before answering it, he might have surmised that both Vivian and Joan were sitting on the sofa in Allan\'92s living room. Allan was standing near them, holding the phone, providing Oakley\'92s question for their benefit. Joan was holding Vivian\'92s hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan shook his head and mouthed to Vivian and Joan, \'93No.\'94 A discouraged Vivian buried her head in her hands. She had hoped that Oakley was calling to tell Allan that he was returning home to Brookline. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Are you going back to Reno?\'94 Allan asked.\uc0\u8232 \'93No,\'94 replied Oakley. \'93My face is too well known.\'94

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I see. Somewhere else,\'94 Allan informed the girls while speaking to Oakley. \'93Allan, give me Joan\'92s phone number,\'94 said Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93You want their phone number?\'94 repeated Allan while looking at Vivian

\fs32 \cf3 The MIT math club met in the mathematics department library, a more congenial location than a lecture hall. The goal was to attract students to an enticing environment, not to subject them to what they might consider to be another course. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The vast majority of book and periodical holdings were housed in the Hayden Library on campus, but the math department library had a couple shelves of the most frequently referenced books, current periodicals, books that the Hayden Library thought were obsolete, and books provided to the department by retired or the families of deceased professors. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A tray of cookies, tea bags, a pitcher of hot water, cups, and a coffee pot sat on a circular wooden table to the side of a blackboard. Instead of classroom desks, comfortable plastic chairs with curved rather than vertical backs were located randomly around the room. Nearly every seat was taken by the twenty students and a few faculty attending. The blackboard was full of equations, tables of numbers, graphs, and a notice at the top of the blackboard which read

\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Professor Ted Martin, the chairman of the math department, sat next to a couple of students. Oakley leaned against a lectern just in front of the blackboard. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Professor Thorp, you say we should increase our bets if the deck gets hot. But it seems to me that will alert the dealer, and they\'92ll just shuffle the deck on you,\'94 said one of the students.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93That\'92s a very good observation, Rick,\'94 said Oakley. \'93That\'92s why I suggest you limit the size of your bets to perhaps no more than five times your mini- mum bet. That was actually the idea of a friend of mine. And sometimes to hide that you\'92re playing my system, bet a large bet at the beginning of a fresh deck. You could even bet a large bet every once in a while when the deck gets cold, just to throw them off the track.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yes, Flash?\'94 he said to another. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley knew the names of all his students. With only about twenty stu- dents in the math club, Oakley had no trouble learning their names. He also made a point of learning the names at the beginning of semesters of all the students in his classes. It was easy to do in the relatively low enrollment upper- class courses, but it was more difficult in the large enrollment introductory calculus class. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 One student had asked him if he was indeed trying to learn the names of all the students, and Oakley told him he was trying. He explained that this is MIT, and that some are sure to become Nobel Prize winners, members of the National Academy of Sciences, Fellows of the American Physical Society, Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, and, even better, his future colleagues wherever their respective space-time world lines might take them, perhaps even back to MIT. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Professor Thorp. How about just waiting until the deck gets hot to enter the game?\'94 he asked. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Great. Such bright students here. Yeah. I call that \'91strike when the deck is hot.\'92 It limits how long you can play, of course. But here\'92s the idea. Stand behind the players\'92 backs and watch the play. Count the cards and wait until the count gets favorable. Then quickly sit down and bet a large bet. You\'92re starting with a hot deck, and the dealer has no idea that this is for you a large bet because you haven\'92t established a betting pattern.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 One of the students laughed. \'93That\'92s great,\'94 he said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Isn\'92t it though, Mr. Ferguson? It\'92s essentially countering the casino shuf- fling when the deck is hot by not playing when the deck is cold.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But it\'92s a great way to make some quick lunch money or pay for your lift tickets,\'94 said Flash. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Right. En route to the restaurant, stand back behind a table until the deck gets hot and then make your strategic strike so to speak.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93It\'92s like jungle warfare,\'94 noted Ferguson. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That has occurred to me, Mr. Ferguson,\'94 answered Oakley. \'93We use cam- ouflage, sudden surprise attacks, and we try to blend in with the non-system players.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Someone should write a book about that waiting until the deck gets hot strategy,\'94 Ferguson said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why not you, Mr. Ferguson? There\'92s a similar team strategy I\'92ve thought about. The members sit at tables laying down small bets. Then when the deck gets favorable, they signal another member to sit down and begin laying down large bets.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93There\'92s a spy at the table,\'94 offered another student. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed. \'93Right, you could be that spy, Ivan Ivanovich Bobchinsky. Or, the members of a team are sitting at a table and when the deck gets hot they as a team raise their total bet, but to avoid detection some of the individuals keep their bet the same or even lower their bet. Okay, unless there are any more questions.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The students and faculty applauded, rose from their seats, and exited the library. Professor Martin approached Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ed,\'94 he said, \'93that\'92s an interesting application. Come and see me in my office tomorrow, okay?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 Normally, the question and answer session at the end of a math club meet- ing lasts shorter than it did after Oakley\'92s \'93Probability Approach to the Card Game 21\'94 presentation. It was now almost 5:30 p.m. and Oakley was anxious to call Allan again. It was Friday, about 2:30 p.m. in L.A., and Oakley knew that Allan often left his office at UCLA early on Fridays. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley placed his briefcase on the desk in his office and sat in the swivel chair next to it. He picked up the phone and dialed Allan\'92s home phone num- ber. He was right. Allan was home. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan sat on his living room sofa holding the telephone. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I don\'92t know how she is, Ed. She spends all of her time at the boutique with Joan.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93All of her time?\'94 Oakley probed.\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah.\'94\u8232 \'93Nights, too?\'94 Oakley probed further. He was basically secure in his rela- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 tionship with Vivian, but their separation, even though it had only been a few days, and the recent turmoil in their lives, would have created doubt for the state of any relationship. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 Allan said. He knew the anguish his friend must have been feeling and needed to reassure him. \'93No need to worry about what Vivian\'92s doing at night, Ed. I couldn\'92t tell you the last time you called because they were here, but Vivian picked up a singing gig at Dick\'92s At The Beach.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs24 \

\fs32 nered by Joan and Vivian. \'93And she\'92s singing at Dick\'92s At The Beach?\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93Yeah. So during the day, they\'92re at Joan and Vivian\'92s boutique. They call it J and V\'92s Design Shoppe. That\'92s S-H-O-P-P-E, of course. At night, they\'92re hanging 
\fs24 \

\fs32 out at Dick\'92s At the Beach. I never see my girlfriend anymore because of you.\'94 \'93What nights are they there?\'94 asked Oakley. He knew that Allan\'92s com- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ment was half in jest.\uc0\u8232 \'93Every night,\'94 Allan informed him. He wanted to provide further assur- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 ance to his friend. \'93Every single night, Ed. Except July Fourth or if there\'92s an earthquake.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 *** 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It being Friday when Ted Martin asked Oakley to see him in his office, by \'93tomorrow\'94 he meant Monday. Perhaps he had in fact forgotten it was Friday. In any case, Oakley spent a difficult weekend alone. He was content that Vivian was occupied, doing what she loved, and not meandering so to speak, but the thought of the looming conversation with the chairman of his depart- ment was one from which Oakley couldn\'92t escape. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 With their classes and office hours absorbing the day, Oakley didn\'92t make it to Professor Martin\'92s office until late in the afternoon. Martin had to leave so they decided to have their meeting while walking across campus. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The Moore Instructorship, as you know, is normally a two-year appoint- ment,\'94 Martin informed Oakley after some small talk. \'93And it\'92s rare that we offer a tenure-track position after its completion.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The conversation was not turning out well. Oakley decided to forego the introduction to the subject and bring up the obvious. \'93What you\'92re saying, Ted, is you don\'92t approve of my gambling experiments.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ed. I\'92m not the type to play games, you know that,\'94 said Professor Martin. \'93Gambling or mind games.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93But you don\'92t approve,\'94 Oakley continued. He wanted any pain that he was to experience to be quick. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If I didn\'92t approve, Ed, I\'92d say so. Besides, I like to think of you as another Norbert Weiner. And his eccentricities are legendary.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m eccentric?\'94 asked Oakley, beginning to be relieved. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You\'92re a mathematician, Ed. And eccentric is good. Professor Shannon and you get along very well, building those roulette-computing machines and testing them in Nevada. Someday they\'92ll be in the MIT museum, I\'92m sure. That\'92s good. Eccentric is good.\'94

\fs32 \cf3 \'93But. . .,\'94 Oakley began, not giving up on his attempts at suicidally throwing himself into the fire with Giordano Bruno. He was interrupted by two students passing by. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hi, Professor Thorp,\'94 said the woman student. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hi, Judith. Hi, Flash,\'94 Oakley replied, knowing, of course, the names both of his student and his student\'92s girlfriend. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93However,\'94 said Professor Martin, continuing Oakley\'92s truncated sentence, \'93some of the other faculty don\'92t approve.\'94 He pointed to the two students. \'93But the students love you,\'94 he added. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 said Oakley, resigned to what was coming next. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Frankly, I think it\'92s part jealousy,\'94 said Professor Martin. Oakley was get- ting annoyed that Martin was taking the academic knife and churning it deeper and deeper into his abdomen instead of just relating his obvious deci- sion. \'93You\'92re, what, thirty years old?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93In August,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Twenty-nine years old. You\'92ve gotten more recognition for your work than just about anybody here,\'94 noted Professor Martin. \'93Not to mention the tele- vision appearances.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Not the best publicity for the department, I admit,\'94 admitted Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93If it attracts good students, who cares?\'94 stated Professor Martin. \'93But it doesn\'92t matter to me, Ed. The point is, as you know, the instructorship is a two-year appointment.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They had reached the permit annex parking lot north of building 2 across Vassar Street and now stopped by Oakley\'92s red T-Bird. Oakley looked at the fender of the T-Bird, wet his finger, and rubbed a spot. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Dent,\'94 he explained to Professor Martin. This seemed to be a trick motif he used to diffuse painful situations, and Martin\'92s last comment made it clear that this was going to be a painful situation. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Professor Martin pulled a letter out of his shirt pocket and handed it to Oakley. Oakley stopped repairing his car, took the letter from Professor Martin, and held it without reading it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Besides,\'94 he said, \'93Ralph Crouch wanted to know when you\'92d be available. He wants you to join his game theory group at New Mexico State. Perhaps in the fall.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed. \'93You\'92re kidding\'94 were the only words he could say. The thoughts and emotions that instantly welled up within him were synergistic in creating unbounded joy. Losing this position would have been a difficult event in his marriage. Vivian was on the west coast, where she was happy, her music and design careers going well. Being suddenly unemployed might have been the reason for her to remain there. Now, in contrast, he would be relocat- ing to the west and they would both be happy, personally and professionally.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley\'92s academic career, instead of being jeopardized, was apparently flourishing. At the end of his appointment in the Moore instructorship posi- tion he would join the faculty at New Mexico State. It was obvious that his investigations, \'93research\'94 perhaps being too lofty of a term, into blackjack had been not only recognized by peers in game theory but applauded. All was well. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Professor Martin, for some reason, had been toying with him. Perhaps it was some sort of intellectual game that he, of higher academic status than Oakley, wanted to play. Perhaps he was the faculty member to whom he had referred as being jealous, although Oakley doubted that, knowing that Martin did not, as he had said, play games, gambling or mind games, in his words. Perhaps he just wanted Oakley\'92s pleasure to be that much greater, rebounding from the emotional abyss of the Mindanao Trench to the emotional pinnacle of the peak of Mt. Everest. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They are very high on you, Edward. Ralph said your research on blackjack is the greatest achievement in probability since Cardano. He thinks you have made yourself an immortal.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley chuckled briefly. His mind was overflowing with multiple stimuli, the recollections of the immortality conversation by the Truckee River, feel- ings of humility mixed with amusement that he would be spoken of in the same sentence with the famed sixteenth century mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, the developer of the field of probability theory, and his eagerness to read Crouch\'92s letter. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He read the letter silently. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Ralph also wants someone who can relate to undergraduates,\'94 Professor Martin continued. \'93And, it seems they have a bunch of guys that regularly visit Nevada. Ralph, you\'92ll find, is quite the outgoing character. No doubt they\'92re all interested in your work.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley read excerpts from the letter out loud, perhaps to make sure he wasn\'92t dreaming. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Tenure track professorship, I get a corner window office, I only have to teach one class a semester, and I get my own university car for field trips.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I didn\'92t know mathematicians take field trips,\'94 he observed to Martin, catching his breath. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93They must really be interested in your work,\'94 Professor Martin replied. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was concerned about the trip to Puerto Rico with Manny Kimmel and his nieces. There was the crime problem, traveling off the mainland to, if not a foreign country then a commonwealth with a significant low-income

\fs32 \cf3 population rather than a state. Traveling with two ravishing, voluptuous blondes to Puerto Rico seemed to be asking for trouble, even with Manny\'92s gangster reputation protection. He wasn\'92t a large man, and Oakley, though over six feet tall, was slight of build. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He, in addition, couldn\'92t think of Vivian without accompanying guilty feelings. He wasn\'92t abandoning her, but he was ignoring her feelings. Perhaps to divert his conflicting thoughts, perhaps to let Vivian know he was thinking about her, perhaps to prevent himself from making a potentially disastrous phone call, probably for all these reasons, he decided to record and then send a message. Because it would arrive at Allan\'92s when he was in Puerto Rico, none of them could use the communication to try to dissuade him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A tape recorder, telephone, several darts, a photograph of Vivian, and a large envelope lay on the living room table in their rented home in Brookline. A music stand propping up a piece of sheet music stood next to the table. A dart board hung on the wall. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 While he held his trumpet, Oakley sang the lyrics to \'93These Foolish Things\'94 into a microphone connected to the tape recorder.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 He placed the microphone on the table, picked up his trumpet, and played four bars of music. He bobbed his head and smiled in admiration at the licks he had improvised and then placed his trumpet on the table and picked up the microphone. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He continued singing.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Finished, he spoke into the microphone. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92m sure you don\'92t know who this is,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Here\'92s a hint. I\'92m not much of a singer, but you once said I was the greatest trumpet player in the world. Vivian, I have only one more of these gambling experiments. But I\'92ve gotta do it. It\'92s the last one. I promised you that I\'92d never lie to you again and

\fs32 \cf3 I\'92m keeping that promise. I miss you very much. And I love you very much. But I gotta do this. Ed.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was sure that the song would remind Vivian of the moments that Sunday morning he had gotten onto the bus to go back to UCLA after the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, where they had met. He removed the tape from the tape recorder and placed it into the envelope. He stared alter- nately at the telephone and the darts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He picked up the phone. He had decided to send the package rather than call her, but he began to reconsider, needing to talk to the woman he loved. He thought for a second about the possible repercussions and then quickly put the phone down. He picked up the darts and forcefully threw one toward the dart board on the wall. It missed and fell to the floor.

\fs32 \cf3 Most American gamblers have never played in Puerto Rico. The expenses of the plane flight and accommodations deter many. The very name of the U. S. territory itself scares many people based on tales of Puerto Rican gangs in major American cities. It\'92s logical to assume that only the affluent can reach the U. S. mainland, and if their children become gang members, then those left behind in the squalor of the low-income barrios must be that much more violent. Combining that with activities in the gambling business would repel most people, especially if you expect to carry cash with you into the casinos. Manny Kimmel, as a well-known if not particularly feared American gangster, had implicit protection. You can mess with American tourists, but you don\'92t mess with American gangsters or the street cleaners might find your body lying in some gutter. Oakley wasn\'92t that concerned. He considered Manny as effectively being his bodyguard. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Santurce is one of the districts of San Juan, the largest as well as the capi- tal city of Puerto Rico, located on the north shore in the eastern part of the island. Within Santurce is El Condado, an oceanfront so-called sub-district of about 3000 middle and upper-class residents. El Condado was home to sev- eral casinos, but, because it also housed an expansive resort, Manny preferred staying at La Concha over other hotel-casino locations in El Condado such as the Diamond Palace, Caribe, and Condado Plaza. He had traveled to El Condado in the past, and he knew that his nieces could entertain themselves in the resort, rather than potentially disrupting Oakley\'92s gambling. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 None of these casinos were as lavish as the casinos of South Lake Tahoe or the higher end casinos in Reno, but, as Oakley would say, it\'92s the same game

\fs32 \cf3 at every table at every casino. That is true except for minor rule variations, most notably, whether the dealer has to stand on soft 17, that is, a hand com- posed of an Ace and a six. In Puerto Rico, the rule stated that the dealer has to stand on soft 17, just as in most Nevada casinos. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley felt that he would most likely never return to these casinos and that any photographs taken of him in Nevada casinos would most likely not have been shared with their Puerto Rican counterparts. As a result, whenever the deck became favorable he was betting the unfortunately low house limits of $50. The Puerto Rican dealers dealt more quickly than those in Nevada, as Manny had mentioned, somewhat offsetting the low table limit in determin- ing the player\'92s potential action each hour. When they were available, he was laying bets on up to the entire seven positions on the table, further increasing the potential action. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The casinos, unlike in Nevada, were open only between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. This necessitated a stressful roughly twelve hour adjustment in Oakley\'92s daily schedule from his work day in Cambridge. The first four days, Oakley played in the late evenings and mornings at the Caribe, the Diamond Palace, and the Condado Plaza, hitting each casino for one to two hours on a given shift, and then taking a break and waiting for the next shift to repeat the cycle of visits. In the early evening, after dinner with Manny and his nieces, he played in the friendly confines of their home base, La Concha. This was really the only time that the girls would watch, Manny demanding, as any good solicitous uncle would, that they remain inside the resort. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 This was, to tell the truth, marginally violating the paper route technique of not winning too much or staying too long at a given casino in order to avoid excessive scrutiny. Although he wasn\'92t staying at a given casino more than a couple hours, when playing with a favorable deck he was both betting fairly heavily, near or at the table maximum of $50, and taking multiple hands. More importantly, he was winning substantially. The paper route technique would direct the player to leave a casino if doing so. Nonetheless, feeling, as I said, that he\'92d never come back to gamble in Puerto Rico, Oakley hoped that the casino bosses were just waiting for his luck to turn. The paper route tech- nique was again showing its value, even if Oakley was marginally violating it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They had a reason to hope that Oakley\'92s luck would turn. Although early in the playing he had been down about $2000, he had, in the first four days of playing, won about $700 at the Caribe, $1200 at the Diamond Palace, $1100 at Condado Plaza, and $1400 at La Concha. That totaled about $4400 compared to the $6000 he had made playing in South Lake Tahoe and Reno. If the table limit had been $500, as it was in most of the Nevada casinos, and he were playing just one hand at a time, as he had in Nevada, instead of the

\fs32 \cf3 four hands he had been typically playing in Puerto Rico, he would have made about twice as much. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Knowing his winnings, and now that he was keeping a log, he could get a reasonably good estimate of the power of the complete point count system in practice and could compare it to Julian\'92s computer predictions. Oakley esti- mated he had played about 28 hours, so that he was making about $150 per hour, which seemed great. It was, after all, almost as much, Oakley lamented, as the head coaches at Boston College made. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He, however, wanted to calculate if these winnings were consistent with the predictions. First he had to calculate his action, how much he had bet. Figuring that he was betting a minimum of $20 at an average of four posi- tions, his effective minimum bet per round of hands was $80. His effective maximum bet per round was similarly four times $50 or $200, so that his average bet per round was about $140. He estimated that he had played 100 rounds each hour on the average, so that his total action based on an average bet of $140 was 100 rounds per hour times 28 hours times $140 per round, or about $392,000. Winning $4,400 meant his rate of winning was 1.1%, nearly ten times the rate of winning of 0.12% with the basic strategy. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Although that was a respectable rate, the highly advantageous very \'93hot\'94 deck promising dazzlingly large winnings hadn\'92t yet appeared. Julian\'92s calcula- tions had shown that after playing roughly half way through the deck, limit- ing his maximum bet to only twice his minimum bet, he should have been making about 1.5% of his action. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Another reason for continuing existed. His total winnings had basically dou- bled Manny\'92s bankroll, which was the so-called business agreement. Manny, though, to seal the business deal, had demanded that he make that $10,000 as a profit, after expenses. The expensive little vacation to La Condado required Oakley to play on. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The winnings at the Caribe would have been greater, Oakley rational- ized, but he had been cheated. The dealer seemed extraordinarily clumsy. On repeated hands, two cards would keep trying to come through the slit in the shoe and would get jammed, followed by the dealer\'92s fumbling around to extract them. When Oakley moved to another table, the shoe was moved with him. When Oakley moved to a third table, the shoe was remarkably moved with him again. It seemed as if the shoe had been manufactured to allow the dealing of seconds, as Manny had described at the consultant ses- sion in Brookline. Either the casino had become aware of Oakley through some international grapevine or American news outlet, or they simply didn\'92t want him to take any more of their money. Whatever the case, Oakley would no longer gamble at the Caribe.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley was taking advantage of two aspects of the Puerto Rican rules, having the cards dealt face up to the players and using a double deck of two fifty-two card decks, a total of 104 cards. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Having the players\'92 cards dealt face up was a major advantage. If he were playing all seven positions, he could have fifteen cards in his count, includ- ing the dealer\'92s up-card, aiding his strategy decisions even on the first hand he was playing. It was natural for him to stare at his own cards, and as they were dealt he could obtain the point count at the start of the hand. He could do this quickly, using the holistic technique of visually canceling out images pair wise that he had developed in Reno rather than sequentially adding plus and minus ones. In this way, no need existed to scan the table as other players busted their hands. He could easily keep the running count as each additional card was played, providing him with current information from which to make his strategy decisions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The use of double decks also proved advantageous. He was at times using the \'93strike when the deck is hot\'94 technique. He would observe a table where only one or two players sat, wait until the point count was positive, and then sit down and bet the maximum $50 bet at all the remaining places. With a double deck, the favorable decks would stay favorable longer. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He also discovered the seemingly miraculous effects of employing what he was now calling \'93end play.\'94 He had become aware of its possible lucra- tive benefits ever since Manny had told him of the rules variations in Puerto Rican casinos. The casinos would deal down to the second to last card in the deck. This enabled him to achieve a great advantage if the last cards in the deck were predominantly either low point value cards or high point value cards. If, for example, the point count indicated that the last five or ten cards were all twos through sixes, he would take multiple hands and, knowing the deck favored the house, bet low. He would draw all of those cards. When the dealer was forced to shuffle, those cards would be absent from the newly shuffled deck. Oakley would be at an advantage for the entire run of that new double deck. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 If, say, ten or fifteen cards were left and most but not all were low-value cards, for another example, he would again take multiple hands and bet low. If he got a pair of tens or an 18 or 19, he would take a hit to bust the hand. He would do the same if given a natural, that is, a ten-value card and an Ace, if the casino allowed. He would draw enough cards to the hands composed of low-value cards but without busting them, to utilize all the remaining cards. The newly shuffled deck would then be replenished with the ten-value cards and Aces from the hands he had busted, but would be depleted in the low- value cards that remained on the table, as in the first example. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 189 
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 If, on the other hand, the last five or ten cards were all ten-value cards or Aces, Oakley would place large bets, the $50 maximum, on as many places as needed to ensure that the dealer would not have a high-value card, that is, a ten-value card or an Ace, left in the deck with which to finish the hand. The deck depleted, the dealer would have to shuffle the deck, and the card he or she would then deal to himself or herself would be from a deck depleted in ten-value cards and Aces. Oakley knew that his advantages in such end play cases could be far greater than 10%. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 After all was said and done, however, it was clear that Julian\'92s strategy modi- fications of the complete point count system for the Puerto Rican game were effective. The system was working as well as it had in Nevada. Oakley was content. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On his fifth day in El Condado, following the sumptuous dinner at La Concha with Manny and his nieces to which they had become accustomed, Oakley played alone at the Diamond Palace. For two hours, the decks swung between being favorable and unfavorable. When it was unfavorable, Oakley reduced his bet, but lost moderately. When it was favorable, he increased his bet, but continued to lose. After about what seemed 200 years of such anguish, a favorable deck rewarded his faith and he picked up $150 in ten minutes. He was about even. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was tired and still sluggish from the large meal and decided to obey the paper route technique and leave the Diamond Palace. Manny suggested they return to La Concha, where Oakley had had his best success, for a light snack break. He could also watch over his nieces. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Perhaps the best-known casino to the American gamblers who come to Puerto Rico is La Concha. La Concha was more finely decorated than the Diamond Palace, Caribe, or Condado Plaza but still somewhat different from the lavish American casinos. Although live palm trees were planted outside the entrance and placed in large planters in the lobby and dining areas, the only palm trees within the casino itself were plastic. Without any windows, the norm for casinos, where management tries to prevent players from know- ing the time, any live plants would soon wither. The plastic palm trees in the casino showed lack of care, their green color muted by dust. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The blackjack tables were covered with the customary felt, and the design, with the betting squares, cash drop box, and chip tray, would be familiar to American gamblers. The felt at most of the tables had cigarette burns and drink stains. The dealers, almost all women, advertised their second occupa- tion by wearing low cut white frilly blouses, showing enough curves to dis- tract the players. Being a resort, La Concha offered numerous opportunities and locations for diversion.

\fs32 \cf3 Juanita, in her mid 20s, was no exception. Her name tag read \'93Juanita,\'94 and the sheer fabric of her blouse sagged under its otherwise inconsequen- tial weight. Oakley had played at La Concha but hadn\'92t yet met Juanita. He would remember her well. It was nearly midnight in Puerto Rico. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley sat alone, dressed in a suit coat, tie, and long-sleeved white shirt, the required dress for Puerto Rican casinos. The shirt alone showed he was an American tourist. The 90 degree temperatures called for short-sleeved shirts. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 La Concha continued to be kind to Oakley. He had bought $500 in $25 chips from the cashier, and next to that bank on the table sat his winnings, a pile of about thirteen $25 chips and ten $5 chips, a total of $350. He was playing three hands and betting a minimum bet of $25. A Jack of Diamonds and a six of Hearts were face-up on the table in front of him, next to eight $5 chips, a $40 bet. His other hands totaled 17 and 19, both standing totals against Juanita\'92s up-card of a five of Diamonds. He had $40 bets sitting next to them as well. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita busted, drawing a ten of Clubs to go with her now revealed down card of a King of Hearts. Juanita took twenty-four $5 chips from her tray and placed them, eight at a time, next to Oakley\'92s bets. He was now up more than $450 at Juanita\'92s table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita spoke with a thick accent. \'93You be lucky player, mister,\'94 she smiled. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Over the next half an hour he picked up another $125, an amount about equal to the winnings on that one hand. His initial $500 bank had more than doubled, twenty-one $25 chips and fourteen $5 chips, a total of $595, lying on the table in front of him next to the original $500 bank. He had made nearly $600 since sitting at Juanita\'92s table. Manny was standing behind Oakley, not saying anything. He seemed content to simply count up the number of chips accumulating in front of his professor colleague. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley\'92s tie was loosened at the collar. By this time, a small crowd, attracted by the large piles of $5 chips and $25 chips piled up in front of Oakley, had assembled behind his table, joining Manny in watching the American play. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 A pit boss had come by briefly, but Juanita had said some words to him and he quickly left. Juanita felt she could make more money doing a trick with this gringo, and the pit boss knew he would get a share. Such commis- sions, so to speak, especially when dealing with a wealthy American, must have been much more than the pit boss could earn in any San Juan casino. Perhaps the men behind the one-way windows in the ceiling were also in the consortium. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 At some time during the next forty-five minutes, the deck must have communicated with that at the Diamond Palace, which had tortured him. It decided to run neutral to cold. Oakley had lowered his bet to his mini- 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \cf3 mum $25 and had kept his losses down to only a bit more than $100. He was still up nearly $500. Some of the crowd had dispersed, and at one point another player sat down. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 In American casinos, the dealer would have taken a break to be replaced by another. When Juanita\'92s time had come for a break, the pit boss walked over with another woman, but Juanita said some words in Spanish to them and they left. It was one of the few times in his life that Oakley wished he had studied Spanish in high school instead of French. Soon after that brief episode the deck turned in Oakley\'92s favor. Perhaps it was the French goddess of language showing compassion. She, it would turn out, was an extremely compassionate goddess. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley was playing seven hands, each with the maximum $50 bet, two $25 chips. He had used end play on the previous deck, and the newly shuffled deck began with a point count of +5. Oakley\'92s suit coat was draped over the back of his seat. His shirt sleeves were rolled up and his tie was hanging from his neck, unknotted. This was big business. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 They played two rounds, Oakley taking seven hands in each, and the deck became more favorable to Oakley, with three more twos through sixes being played than ten-value cards and Aces. The point count was now +8. With 46 cards having been dealt and viewed, only 58 cards remained from the 104-card double deck. The high-low index was +8/58 \'d7 100, or about +13. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The complete point count system directed a bet of one-half the high-low index times his minimum bet. That minimum bet was $25, so that his bet with a high-low index of +13 should now have been 1/2 \'d7 13 \'d7 $25, or about $150 per hand. Unfortunately, the house limit was $50. He was relegated to playing on with that bet, satisfied with taking multiple hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 On the next hand, Juanita dealt herself an up-card of a six of Hearts, increasing the point count to +9. The cards dealt to Oakley were, as always in Puerto Rico, dealt face up. His first hand consisted of a nine of Clubs and a Jack of Spades, a pat hand. The second hand was the Ace of Diamonds and the Ace of Clubs, a hand to be split. The third two cards were a ten of Hearts and a Queen of Diamonds. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 His last four hands were a mix, a six of Spades and nine of Diamonds, a ten of Clubs and a six of Diamonds, a pair of sevens, and the second six of Hearts in the deck with a five of Diamonds. With his eyes, he had quickly canceled out the various pairs of ten-value cards and Aces with the low-value cards in his seven hands and Juanita\'92s up-card to determine that the point count had increased by +2 to +6. The high-low index, with 61 cards played and viewed from the 104-card deck was +6/43 \'d7 100, or about +14.

\fs32 \cf3 Oakley was in a great place. He cracked a slight grin, sensing that the action he had awaited all evening was about to begin. The small crowd was hushed, but electrified with anticipation as to what the gringo would do. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley waved his hand over his first pair of cards, a pat hand. He then moved the Ace of Clubs to the right of the Ace of Diamonds. As expected from any player, he was splitting the Aces. He placed two $25 chips next to the Ace of Clubs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 he said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita dealt an eight of Clubs next to the Ace of Clubs and a Jack of Hearts next to the Ace of Diamonds, giving Oakley two more pat hands and a total of $400 on the table. The point count was +5 and the high-low index was +5/41 \'d7 100, or about +12. She pointed to the two hands. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stand,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley now played his third hand, moving the ten of Hearts to the right of the Queen of Diamonds. He placed two $25 chips next to the ten of Hearts. He was going to split the tens. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 said the monosyllabic hero. Oakley\'92s table for splitting said to split tens against the dealer\'92s 6 if the high-low index was above +7. It was +12. Oakley had seen the interchange between Juanita and the pit boss. He was sure they didn\'92t have his picture in Puerto Rico, and he hadn\'92t been playing long enough to have revealed that he was playing a viable system. In any case, he reasoned, they probably had never seen his type of play previously. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The small crowd gasped audibly at his strategy choice. It was almost certain that none of them had ever seen a man split tens, an almost sure winning hand. The pit boss came over, more to see the cause of the commotion than to cause trouble. Juanita gave him a quick warning look, then turned back to Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You split the tens, mister?\'94 she said, her Spanish accent being even more pronounced as she lost some composure. \'93Never you should to split the tens,\'94 she said maternally. Oakley was touched by her affection, but then thought that her comment may have been motivated a little by greed. The more money he made at the tables, the more money she might expect to get as a tip or, better, earn on her anticipated second job. He now had $450 on the table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita dealt a nine of Hearts next to the ten of Hearts and a Jack of Clubs next to the Queen of Diamonds, two more pat hands. Oakley stared at the cards for a second. The point count had been reduced to +4, and the high-low index was +4/39 \'d7 100, or about +10, still greater than the +7 for splitting a pair of tens against a dealer\'92s 6. Juanita pointed to the two hands. Oakley kept on thinking. It was obvious that he had reached a point in the deck that called for some mental calculation, and he wanted to be sure that the cash on

\fs32 \cf3 the table, the crowd, and the smiling Juanita had not caused some left-mode neurons to misfire. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Many of those who had left when Oakley ran into his cold streak had returned. Others had joined them, making a crowd of about twenty-five peo- ple standing behind the blackjack table. He waved his hand over the nine of Diamonds and ten of Hearts, but then moved the Queen of Diamonds to the right of the Jack of Clubs. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 he said, announcing his decision as he put two more $25 chips next to the Queen of Diamonds. Five hundred dollars of Oakley\'92s money now lay on the table. He had only laid down more at Harold\'92s when he doubled and split to have $900 on the table, but the table limit there had been $500 and here it was only $50. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita placed the second Ace of Diamonds in the deck next to the Queen of Diamonds, a nice touch, Oakley thought, and a King of Spades next to the Jack of Clubs. He wondered if Juanita had seen all the Diamonds on the table and had begun to dream of baubles that this American might bestow in his largesse upon her. The count was +3 and the high-low index was now +3/37 \'d7 100, or about +8. The splitting table of the complete point count system directed Oakley to split the tens, for the third time, saying split tens against the dealer\'92s 6 if the high-low index was, as I said, greater than +7. This was clearly getting into murky waters. Although the pit boss was not interfering with Juanita\'92s seduction efforts, Oakley had no idea if he was being observed from above. Splitting again was sure to generate attention, at least from the audience standing behind him. The index was +8. The system he was using was his. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He moved the King of Spades to the right of the Jack of Clubs and placed two $25 chips next to it. That\'92s $550 and counting. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 he announced over the casino loudspeaker. It might as well have been the loudspeaker. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He didn\'92t notice the many comments from the fans because something was pushing against his back. He turned to see Manny frantically shaking his head \'93No.\'94 Oakley had never previously seen a man kill himself by breaking his own neck. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita saw this and might have figured this man was Oakley\'92s father. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Mister, I give to you the chance no to split the tens.\'94 Oakley believed she was concerned for him. Maybe she was thinking this man was 
\f2\i loco 
\f1\i0 altogether. Oakley shook his head in rejecting the offer and Juanita dealt. She placed a seven of Spades next to the King of Spades and a ten of Diamonds next to the Jack of Clubs. A couple voices in the crowd began a subdued chant of \'93split . . . split . . . split.\'94 Spanish voices commanded, \'93

\fs32 \cf3 The point count was now +2 and the high-low index was +2/35 \'d7 100, or about +6. He stood with the seven of Spades and the King of Spades. Juanita pointed to the second split hand, the Jack of Clubs and ten of Diamonds. With the high-low index at +6, however, no more splitting was called for. Oakley\'92s disappointed fans would have to wait by the players\'92 entrance to get his explanation as well as autograph. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Stand,\'94 he said. This caused both confusion and relief among those watch- ing. This guy had already split a pair of tens three times, some may have thought, so he should do the same again. It\'92s a stupid play, usually, they also may have thought, so maybe it\'92s good he finally just stood. Juanita took a deep breath, perhaps in relief that her man would not place any additional fool- ish bets. Manny, his head apparently still connected to the rest of his torso, removed the pressure on Oakley\'92s back. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Following this brilliant assault, Oakley arched his head back to crack his neck vertebrae to relieve some tension. He still had four hands to play. Juanita pointed to his fourth hand, that of a six of Spades and nine of Diamonds. Oakley\'92s hard drawing and standing table said to stand with a hard total of 15 against the dealer\'92s 6 if the high-low index exceeds \'9628. As Oakley waved over the cards to say he was standing, some murmurs were heard in the crowd. He similarly stood on the fifth hand, the ten of Clubs and a six of Diamonds. Now he faced a pair of sevens. The gamblers\'92 saying goes \'93always split Aces and eights,\'94 with other pairs to be split according to the pain tolerance of the player. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Even Oakley\'92s basic strategy, however, directed the player to always split sevens against the dealer\'92s six, a strategy in common with the complete point count system. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Split,\'94 said Oakley, for the fifth time in the last minute and a half. He had split Aces, tens, and sevens. One might have thought he was auditioning for a job as a ballet instructor. He placed another $50 next to the first seven. The table held $600 of Oakley\'92s chips. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita sighed, lowered her head in deep sorrow, but obliged, delivering a Jack of Diamonds and a five of Spades. The point count was now +2 and the high-low index was +2/33 \'d7 100, or about +6. His decision about the first hand, a total of seventeen, was easy. He waved his hand over the cards to signify he was standing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The second split hand, a total of 12 against the dealer\'92s 6, is one of those that cause consternation among blackjack players. It is as close to a \'93call it\'94 as exists. The hard drawing and standing table directs the player to stand if the high-low index is greater than zero. In other words, half the time you should stand and half the time you should take a card. No wonder it causes the con- sternation among players that it does.

\fs32 \cf3 Indeed, of all the entries in Oakley\'92s five strategy tables, splitting, hard and soft doubling down, and hard and soft drawing and standing, only five entries were zero. These were splitting fours against the dealer\'92s up-card of 5, split- ting sixes against the dealer\'92s 2, hard doubling holding 9 against the dealer\'92s 3, soft doubling 19, that is, the Ace and eight, against the dealer\'92s 6, and, alone among the entries in the hard drawing and standing table, Oakley\'92s presently held 12 against the dealer\'92s 6. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita was pointing at the hand as Oakley remained in his reverie. A quan- titative means of making these borderline decisions was a major strength of his systems. It was one of their

\fs32 As a result, the high-low index remained +6 as Oakley doubled down with his final hand, placing two more $25 chips next to the six of Hearts and five of Diamonds. The hard doubling table directs the player to double down with an 11 against the dealer\'92s 6 if the index exceeds \'9635. Under Puerto Rican rules the player can only double down with an 11. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He had $650 on the table. She dealt him a five of Clubs, for a lousy total of sixteen. The rules of blackjack state that if you double down you get one and only one card. Even if he could have taken a hit, he wouldn\'92t have with the large value of the high-low index and the dealer showing a six. Oakley would be happy if only that hand was a loser. No, he\'92d be ecstatic. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley having played his seven hands, which had become twelve, it was now Juanita\'92s turn. The point count was +3 and the index was +3/32 \'d7 100, or about +9. With such a preponderance of ten-value cards left in the deck, Oakley hoped that Juanita would bust. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 It\'92s good that Oakley was seated or else the crowd squeezing to get a look at Juanita play would have crushed him and his loosened tie against the table, perhaps tilting it and spilling those flat multi-colored cardboard wafers in the chip tray that he was so politely trying to extricate, mathematically speaking. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Juanita flipped over her bottom card to reveal a King of Clubs, giving her a total of sixteen. Less than seventeen meant she had to take another card. She stared at Oakley. The fans stared at the table. Oakley stared at her hand approaching the shoe. She dealt herself a nine of Spades. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Her smile this time was not subtle as the crowd cheered and applauded. She seemed genuinely happy for Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Juanita bust. Juanita bust for you. You like Juanita bust?\'94 she asked, point- ing to her name tag and the possible treasures over which it rode. He was now up more than $1000 at La Concha. In Nevada, with a table limit of $500 as opposed to the $50 table limit in Puerto Rico, that $650 win could have been

\fs32 \cf3 $6500. He thought of Vivian. He wondered if she were here, would she have seen smoke coming out of his ears. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Worried about possible repercussions upstairs, he decided to bet only four places on the next hand. That bit of camouflage might indicate he was lucky, irrational, and in fact not system-addicted. He placed four bets of two $25 chips. Juanita dealt two cards face-up to Oakley at each position and one card face-up and one card face down to herself. The cards to Oakley uncharacter- istically fell short of the betting positions, hitting the table between Oakley and Juanita. Oakley reached out with his hand to pull his cards toward him. Juanita placed her hands on his hand. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She spoke to him, softly, breathing deeply, as if being strangled by genuine passion. It was time for the old closing pitch. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You very good player, mister,\'94 she said. \'93You good at more?\'94 Maybe tonight you show to Juanita, huh?\'94 Juanita, it appeared, was a very affection- ate young lady. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley thought Juanita deserved a break. She had been dealing to him non-stop for three hours. Normally, a shift change occurs every half an hour or forty minutes, but Juanita\'92s understanding with the pit boss had allowed her to continue dealing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Tennis. I\'92m also good at tennis,\'94 Oakley said, scooping up his chips. Normally if you bet and get cards you have to play. Either the pit boss wasn\'92t attentive or he was glad this gringo wasn\'92t going to take more money from his pit. Juanita, still hoping for additional income, didn\'92t complain. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley got up and walked over to the cashier, with Manny closely beside him, protecting Oakley from potential evil-doers, like an armed guard on horseback riding alongside the Wells Fargo wagon of the Old West. Madeleine and Renee had been playing roulette, but, seeing Manny and Oakley at Fort Knox, they walked over to them. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 One can only wonder what Juanita thought. Here was her ticket, walking away with an older man and two healthy, well-fed, blonde American women. Perhaps she thought Manny was Oakley\'92s father and the girls were somehow related. More likely, she would have guessed the girls were in the same occupa- tion as herself. Then, she must have thought, what purpose did the older man serve. The forlorn Juanita was confused. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 She stood alone at her table in the background as Oakley, Manny, Madeleine, and Renee walked past banks of slot machines. Manny held the stack of cash. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Nice,\'94 he said smelling nearly $1700 in various denominations of dollar bills. \'93See Thorp, stick with a sharpie like me and you can get rich.\'94 His bank- roll of $10,000 had turned into $21,000. He was quite content.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93No,\'94 countered Oakley, \'93stick with a mathematician like me, and you can get rich.\'94 The system had proven itself, in Nevada and now, with a different set of rules, in Puerto Rico. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Manny was happy and laughed. \'93Well, we\'92re gonna have a party tonight, right gals?\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Professor Thorp, you going to party with us?\'94 asked Madeleine. Oakley, tall, lanky, professorial, wasn\'92t exactly a symbol of testosterone gone berserk, but that winning system might make someone even as physically gifted as Madeleine reconsider. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I\'92d like to,\'94 said our party animal, \'93but I\'92ve got some lectures to prepare.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I wasn\'92t too good in school,\'94 said Renee, stating what was no doubt a revelation to Oakley. \'93But, I\'92m sure you\'92d be a very, very good teacher.\'94 She wasn\'92t going to let Madeleine get ahead of her in this chase. Manny was a good provider, but he didn\'92t have time on his side. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What are the lectures about?\'94 asked an intrigued Madeleine. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Degeneracy,\'94 answered Oakley. He was telling the truth, but was also interested in the possible responses of the girls. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, wow,\'94 blurted out Renee. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Degeneracy in white dwarfs,\'94 said Oakley, again telling the truth and again anticipating the response of the girls. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Madeleine delivered. \'93That sounds so kinky.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Well, the dwarfs like it,\'94 said Oakley, enjoying the repartee with two gals who didn\'92t know what he was talking about. He made a mental note to tell them about Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\'92s research on the plane home. \'93It basically gives them eternal life.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Renee\'92s head jerked back in puzzlement as Madeleine uttered, \'93What?\'94 Manny\'92s nieces were now probably as confused as Juanita. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The multi-layered conversation ended as they walked past a bank of phone booths. It was nearly 11:00 p.m. in Puerto Rico, about 8:00 p.m. in the San Francisco Bay area. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Gotta make a phone call,\'94 Oakley informed Manny. He walked over to the phone booths and entered one. He dialed \'93O\'94 for the operator at La Concha and asked her to make a call to the United States for him. The call would be billed to his room, with a small surcharge. He could not have cared if they got a couple dollars back from the hundreds he had just won. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 He waited a few seconds while the operator placed the call. He was calling Allan. He had obtained the phone number of J and V\'92s Design Shoppe, but at this moment he was too happy to allow any possibility of a negative response from Vivian to sour his mood. Besides, the tactical warfare plan he had been formulating for the last several months called for a surprise attack.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Allan,\'94 Oakley said to Allan\'92s \'93hello.\'94 \'93This is the guy who just broke the bank at the La Concha Casino in Puerto Rico.\'94 He paused to hear Allan\'92s shocked reply. \'93Right. Puerto R-r-r-rico,\'94 Oakley said, trilling the initial \'91R.\'92 \'93It works. Even putting in Julian\'92s modified coding for the Puerto Rican rule variations. Nobody can doubt it, Allan. I\'92ve been told that this work may make me immortal.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley listened to Allan\'92s happy response and laughed. \'93Yeah. Look,\'94 he said. \'93Don\'92t tell Vivian or Joan, but we\'92re flying back tomorrow and then Friday I\'92m coming into SFO.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Allan must have been happy to hear that his friend and colleague was com- ing back, the experiment a success. He commented about the stealthy surprise being planned for Vivian. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed. \'93I know. It\'92s TWA one thirty-seven. Got that? One-three- seven. Yeah, I know it\'92s the magic number. Just serendipitous. ETA about seven forty-five your time. Pick me up, okay?\'94 Allan agreed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley faced a lot of relationship mending and wanted to make sure Allan understood. \'93Tell Vivian the experiment is over, but don\'92t tell her I\'92m coming in, or you\'92ll blow the whole thing. Okay?\'94

\fs32 \cf3 At the very west end of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, sitting above the boulders placed to retard wave erosion, sits an establishment that should be in the dictionary under the definition of \'93iconic.\'94 Dick\'92s At The Beach is a mis- nomer, there being no bathing in the cold Pacific waters off of San Francisco, not to mention no sand, just the boulders. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The jazz club, small even by jazz club standards, is as far away as you can get from the hubbub of San Francisco and still be in San Francisco. A small stage, at the east side of the venue, looks out over perhaps ten circular tables illuminated by those ubiquitous candles in a white plastic-mesh covered glass globe. Two or three chairs stood around each table. The musicians standing on the stage can look out the west-facing window to the Pacific. Although it was usually difficult to see stars at low elevation through the mist of the ocean, if the Moon was in the right place, the view was more intoxicating than most of the wines served, and spiritual if you were so inclined to that San Francisco sensibility. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Dimly lit, Dick\'92s At The Beach couldn\'92t have been more conducive to lov- ers if the powerful Alioto family had placed a miniature Trevi Fountain by the window facing the ocean. Oakley had wondered why the proprietors, maybe Dick, hadn\'92t come up with the marketing phrase, \'93The Jazz Club by the Ocean in the City by the Bay.\'94 He thought it was pretty enticing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Nearly all the tables were filled with patrons this Friday night. A piano and piano bench, drum set, acoustic bass, and a stool sat on the stage with micro- phones strategically placed in front of them. A music stand stood next to the bass and a thick book of music in a dark blue three-ring binder sat on the

\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian was standing next to the stool singing \'93Teach Me Tonight,\'94 accom- panied by a drummer, bassist, and pianist Andy Narell.

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 Wanting to avoid being spotted by the chanteuse, Oakley, Allan, and Joan had waited by the door next to the stage to enter. They were led to a table near the window, obscured by the darkness in the club. Vivian, partially blinded by a stage light hanging just in front of her, could see three patrons being led by the hostess, but couldn\'92t distinguish their features. She did note that one of them was carrying some sort of small suitcase or overnight bag. It must have been a tourist just in from SFO she thought, flattered that they would come to see her before even going to their hotel. It had been a gig lasting several months and her reputation must have been growing; she congratulated herself. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley carried a trumpet case, not an overnight bag. The three sat at the table, silhouetted by a rising crescent Moon. From the stage, you could see the shimmering of the moonlight on the Pacific Ocean. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian continued to sing as a cocktail waitress approached Oakley, Allan, and Joan\'92s table. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Hi, I\'92m Caralinda. What\'92ll it be, guys?\'94 Caralinda asked.\uc0\u8232 \'93A pitcher of Coors?\'94 Oakley asked Allan and Joan.\u8232 \'93Sounds good,\'94 said Allan.\u8232 \'93Excellent choice,\'94 said Joan, as if Oakley had picked a 1933 French char-

\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Why thank you so much,\'94 she said graciously, smiling. \'93Thank you.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Caralinda stood in front of the stage and spoke briefly to Vivian. Dick\'92s At The Beach was an informal, laid-back, in the San Francisco vernacular, club. Request for songs were common, and Vivian, with a large repertoire and an able back-up band, usually could deliver. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Oh, gosh! Oh, gosh!\'94 Vivian said, visibly moved. She walked over to Andy and spoke to him. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Jon,\'94 said Andy to the bass player, \'93three fourteen in the blue book.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 The bass player picked up the book of music from the floor and put it on his empty music stand. He flipped some pages. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93We\'92ve gotten a request for a song that is very, very dear to me,\'94 said Vivian. \'93And since Andy Narell knows it, we\'92re going to do it!\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Joan leaned over and gave Oakley a kiss on the cheek. This was very cool, she had to admit. She didn\'92t think Oakley had this much romance inside his brilliant body. Allan slapped him on the back. The plan was working as well as the complete point count system had worked.

\fs24 \

\fs32 The puzzled members of the trio exchanged questioning looks at this strange behavior from Vivian as well as the unannounced trumpet sounds coming from the moonlit window table. She finished the tune, with Oakley interjecting jazz licks. She certainly recognized them as his.

\fs32 Mom put down her microphone and yelled \'93Edward!\'94 clearly audible despite the audience applause. She ran off the stage dodging tables and chairs through the audience toward my dad and, not severely injured by the multiple collisions, embraced him.

\fs32 \cf3 Three place settings lay on the morning kitchen table in the Thorp home out- side Irvine, California. Oakley had enjoyed working with Ralph Crouch and his group at New Mexico State, but the University of California at Irvine had made him a generous offer. He would spend the rest of his academic career in their mathematics department. Later he would receive a joint appointment in finance. I\'92m, however, getting a little ahead here. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian was happy, returning to her native California. Oakley was pleased both at his academic succession and at his being closer to the casino action. A triennial gambling conference had begun in Las Vegas, and by now Oakley had become a celebrity, not only there but in the entire casino world. The first, 1962, edition of 
\f2\i Beat the Dealer 
\f1\i0 had made 
\f2\i The New York Times 
\f1\i0 best-seller list. The 1966 edition incorporated the improvements made by Julian Braun using his powerful IBM 7044, to Oakley\'92s pleasure. Oakley had repeatedly put gra- cious acknowledgements of the contributions of both Julian and Harvey Dubner in the new edition. He even talked about Allan Wilson. He credited the Four Horsemen of Aberdeen and his professors for their contributions. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian had set her normal wholesome breakfast meals on the table. At one place setting lay a bowl of cereal and a glass of milk. That was for Fredric, about three years old, my older brother. At a second lay pancakes, a cup of coffee, and a doughnut. That was for Oakley, who was, as his habit, reading the newspaper before driving over to UCI.

\fs32 \cf3 Their dog Gauss lay next to the table, waiting for whatever treats might be offered. He rarely got any other than doggie treats, the Oakley\'92s being ahead of their time in not imposing human food with its additives, sugar, and other dangerous ingredients on canines. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian placed glasses of orange juice before Fredric, Oakley, and at the third place setting, hers. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93I squeezed fresh orange juice,\'94 she said. \'93You\'92ll both need the energy.\'94 \'93Julian\'92s company is doing well,\'94 noted Oakley.\uc0\u8232 \'93And I\'92ll compost the peel and pulp for the Earth. What\'92s it at?\'94 \'93Forty-seven dollars,\'94 said Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Just last week it was forty-two,\'94 recalled Vivian. She turned to Fredric and gave him a dog biscuit. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Honey, here\'92s a Milk-Bone for Gauss. You know,\'94 she said to Oakley, \'93you should call him and say \'91hello\'92 sometime.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Yeah,\'94 said Oakley. \'93Forty-seven and a quarter, actually.\'94 Suddenly his entire attention was directed to the stock prices. He was beginning to go into one of his trances. He dipped his doughnut into his coffee and took a bite. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93DuPont is at twenty-four,\'94 he said. He paused. \'93And a half.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Seeing his dad dip his doughnut, Fredric dipped the Milk-Bone into his glass of milk. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Honey, don\'92t dip it in the milk,\'94 said Vivian to Fredric, chuckling. \'93What\'92s my Sears doing?\'94 she asked Oakley. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Fredric pointed to the Milk-Bone box. \'93Milk bone!\'94 he said emphatically, making the apparent liquid connection before lowering it to Gauss. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed at the indisputable logic and kissed Fredric on the cheek. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Thirty-three,\'94 he replied to Vivian. \'93Even. Kelloggs is twenty-eight and a half.\'94 Oakley was finding magic in the fractional prices. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Daddy, does me have a Sears?\'94 asked Fredric. If mommy has a Sears, then maybe daddy has a Sears, and maybe Fredric has a Sears, he reasoned. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Revlon?\'94 asked Vivian. Some of her boutique friends had been extolling their products. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You sure do, Fredric,\'94 Oakley answered. In a sense he did, being a member of the family. Oakley did think for a moment of the consequences of Fredric being told he in fact did not have a Sears. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sixteen even,\'94 said Oakley, he eyes attached to the page. \'93Can you give me a note pad and pencil, please?\'94 he asked her. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian had seen Oakley in this detached state of mind hundreds of times in their marriage. His brain was in the mathematics mode and verbal communi- cation became sparse. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian walked over to a kitchen drawer. \'93It\'92s never too early in the morning to do mathematics,\'94 she observed. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Me, too,\'94 said Gauss. \'93Like father, like son\'94 had another example in the Oakley household. In many families, the children emulate their parents, in this era usually the father as the sole wage earner. Not only do they gain respect for the particular field, but also any success on the part of the parent facilitates entry of the child into the field, even if the child is not particularly gifted in that field. Colleagues feel somewhat of an obligation to aid the entry of the children into the field of their colleague-friend. In this way, the children of actors, musicians, lawyers, doctors, writers, dentists, dancers, architects, accountants, mathemati- cians, and astronomers, to name just a few, disproportionately enter those fields. The uncle of one of Oakley\'92s heroes, astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, for example, was the noted physicist C. V. Raman, a Nobel Prize winner himself. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian handed both Oakley and Fredric a pencil and pad of paper. Oakley alternately looked at the newspaper and wrote on the notepad. Fredric scribbled. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93You know,\'94 he announced to Vivian, \'93there\'92s a pattern here. The most common closing prices seem to be integers. Then halves, then quarters, and then eighths.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Sixteenths?\'94 she asked. This one of those many times that Vivian wished she had had more formal training in mathematics. She would have loved to have been able to contribute to Oakley\'92s work. This question was reasonable, but she hadn\'92t seen what Oakley was seeing. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Uhh. Wait,\'94 he said, laconically immersed in the analysis. He read the paper and wrote more comments on the note pad. Then he pointed to it. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Look, I\'92ve tabulated twenty closings. Nine are integers, six are halves, four are quarters, and one is an eighth. There may be non-randomness here,\'94 he said to Vivian, looking over his shoulder. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93That\'92s a small sample,\'94 she said. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The differences already are significant to within a square root deviation,\'94 he informed her. \'93There is almost certainly a non-randomness here. But these numbers are for the market as a whole. I have to tally the daily fractional prices for given stocks. See if there\'92s a pattern.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Vivian sat down. \'93A pattern of non-randomness,\'94 she noted, beating Oakley to verbalizing the conclusion now obvious to both of them. \'93Like gambling games. Like blackjack.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Blackjack! Blackjack!\'94 exclaimed Fredric, recognizing the word that had been the topic of innumerable conversations in their household, among both family members, friends, and colleagues.

\fs32 \cf3 \'93Right,\'94 said Oakley, letting Vivian think she had deduced a concept of which he was yet unaware. \'93The stock market is just a gambling game,\'94 he elaborated. \'93The biggest gambling game. Millions of players. Hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day. Billions of dollars of action every year.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93The stock brokers are the dealers and croupiers. And the brokerage houses are the casinos,\'94 said Vivian, extending the metaphor. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley laughed at Vivian\'92s perceptiveness. \'93Think of that! And the stock exchanges and ticker tapes are the gambling devices. You buy a stock and you\'92re making a bet that it\'92ll go up. The brokers take a commission. It\'92s just like a rake in poker, or the house percentage determined by how the rules of craps and the roulette wheel are set.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Even the slogans are the same, \'91ride it while it\'92s hot,\'92 noted Vivian, again making a good point. \'93Or, \'91don\'92t throw good money after bad,\'92 because either the stock is no good or the dealer is cheating you.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93Huh!\'94 exhaled Oakley at the truth of her observations. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93\'91You can\'92t go broke taking a profit,\'92 telling you to not try to sell stock at its peak or to leave the table after winning a big pot to avoid excessive house scrutiny,\'94 added Oakley. \'93There are \'91bull\'92 and \'91bear\'92 markets, just like \'91hot\'92 and \'91cold\'92 streaks. You know, in the long run the market goes up so there has to be an average player\'92s advantage. If there really is non-randomness, we can devise a system.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Oakley and Vivian paused, thinking of the consequences. Fredric continued to scribble on his notepad. Gauss had finished his Milk-Bone. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 \'93What do you think, Fredric?\'94 Oakley asked him. Fredric scribbled on his note pad. Gauss barked.

\fs32 \cf3 Born on September 25, 1929, Julian Braun, was graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology with Bachelor of Science degrees in both mathematics and physics. He obtained his Masters degree from San Diego State College (now San Diego State University) and then taught there briefly before work- ing for Chrysler Corporation in their Missile Systems Division in Detroit. He made his blackjack mark while working at the downtown Chicago research laboratories of IBM from 1961 until his retirement in June, 1987, where he had access to the probably the most powerful computer of the era, the IBM 7044. Not only did he perform the calculations for the revised 1966 edition of 
\f2\i Beat the Dealer
\f1\i0 , but also his superior algorithms led some of the major blackjack students following Thorp to enlist him to perform their calcula- tions. After retirement, he worked as a commodities trader from his Chicago apartment. Braun never married. He died on September 4, 2000, in Chicago at the age of 70 without fanfare, without Thorp\'92s being aware of his illness, and having been unhappy at the lack of recognition and lack of financial reward for his pivotal contribution to the theory of blackjack. He is buried in the Jewish Westlawn Cemetery, located in a near west Chicago suburb, being predeceased by his parents Marcel and Anne, his sister, and his two brothers. The author of the 1980 book, 
\f2\i How to Play Winning Blackjack
\f1\i0 , he is recognized as one of the giant masters by those who have achieved renown in the field.

\fs32 Dr. Allan Wilson (July 21, 1924\'96June 5, 2001) was in fact an acquaintance of Julian Braun at San Diego State College (now San Diego State University). After obtaining his Ph.D in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1955, he was on the faculty of San Diego State College for 3 years, until 1959. (He taught there in 1954 before formally receiving his degree.) He then

\fs32 \cf3 embarked on a 31 year career at the General Dynamics Corporation facility in San Diego from 1960 until 1991. His 1965 book, 
\f2\i The Casino Gambler\'92s Guide
\f1\i0 , expanded and reissued in 1970, remains a classic. It contained a system for blackjack, the Wilson Point-Count System, that he developed and tested in casinos. The book had been in preparation for years, from the 1950\'92s, and an earlier publication could have predated the publication of the 1962 first edition of 
\f2\i Beat the Dealer 
\f1\i0 and thereby rewritten blackjack history. He died in La Jolla in 2001 at the age of 76. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Emmanuel \'93Manny\'94 Kimmel died in 1982 in Boca Raton at the age of 84. Founder of the Kinney Parking Company, he leased garages for storage of liquor during Prohibition. Among other gambling bookmaking activities, at one time he may have been the biggest horseracing bookie on the East Coast.

\fs32 Vivian Sinetar Thorp was the owner of a design consulting firm in Newport Beach, California. She died in 2011 at the age of 82 after more than 50 years of marriage. The Thorps have three children. 
\fs24 \

\fs32 Dr. Edward Thorp (born August 14, 1932) is recognized as the unequalled giant of blackjack. His 1962 book, 
\f2\i Beat the Dealer
\f1\i0 , and especially the 1966 revised edition, revolutionized blackjack strategy and made it the most popu- lar casino game. In 1967 he co-authored the book 
\f2\i Beat the Market
\f1\i0 , which helped launch the derivatives concept that transformed world securities mar- kets. Currently head of Edward O. Thorp and Associates in Newport Beach, California, his mutual fund has achieved an annual average yield of 20% over thirty years.

\f2\i Playing Blackjack to Win
\f1\i0 : 
\f2\i A New Strategy for the Game of 21
\f1\i0 . As young men of 22 to 24 years of age, they now feel that simply choosing a different title, such as 
\f2\i Winning Blackjack
\f1\i0 : 
\f2\i A New Strategy for the Game of 21, 
\f1\i0 would have led to the recognition now given to them mainly by blackjack historians and scholars. The Four Horsemen became lifelong pals.

\fs32 Professor Angus E. Taylor was the author of the most widely used college calculus book in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, 
\f2\i Calculus with Analytic Geometry
\f1\i0 . He died in 1999 at the age of 87.

\fs32 Professor Robert Sorgenfrey was the individual who informed Edward Thorp of the first calculation of the basic strategy by Roger Baldwin and his associates. He died in 1995 at the age of 79.

\fs32 Edward Thorp, Julian Braun, and the Four Horsemen of Aberdeen, Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel, and James McDermott, are induct- ees in the Blackjack Hall of Fame, located in the Barona Casino near San Diego, California. Membership provides the inductee with lifetime free rooms, food 
\fs24 \

\fs32 and beverage service, and shows, with the proviso that the inductee will never play blackjack in the casino. The author believes that the Hall is diminished in stature by the failure of voters to have not yet elected Dr. Harvey Dubner, Jess Marcum, and Allan Wilson.

\fs32 \cf3 Chapter \cf4 5 \cf3 introduced the Vivian Name Game. The letters of Vivian Thorp\'92s maiden name, \'93Artisen\'94 in the novel, contain seven of the eight most fre- quently appearing letters in the English language, lacking only the \'93o.\'94 Words and short content-rich phrases are produced, in the Vivian Name Game, by permuting these seven letters. Some were listed in Chapter \cf4 5\cf3 . To not clutter the narrative, I provide additional such phrases here. As noted in Appendix I, Vivian\'92s actual maiden name was Sinetar. I chose to change it to \'93Artisen\'94 for reference to the creative nature of her fictional character.
